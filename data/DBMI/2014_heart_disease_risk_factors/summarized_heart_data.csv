PCP:		Oliveira, Keith MD



CC/RFA:  SOB.



HPI: Pt is a 76 yo F with a h/o CAD, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, COPD, CHF who developed acute SOB while at home PM of admission. Pt reports no dietary discretions and excellent adherence to medications. She was out evening of admission at a social gathering and noticed symptoms when she returned home and had difficulty climbing an internal staircase in her home She ascended the staircase and was unable to regain her breath. She reports she developed profound dyspnea and tachycardia. She denies chest pain, diaphoresis, dizziness or LOC. She has had a cough productive of clear sputum x 1 week with no fever, night sweats, rigors or chills during this time. She has had no vomiting or diarrhea. She does not recall wheezing, and asserts the only symptoms during the episode consisted in SOB and tachypnea.



Of note, pt had 2 vessel CABG in 11/92. Catheterization on 11/18/92 revealed 100% obstruction of the left proximal circ, 70% proximal LAD obstruction, and 100% obstruction of the mid RCA. 



Course in ED:

En route to BBH pt received Lasix 40 mg, TNG x 3. She was described as pale, cool, and diaphoretic. She was unable to complete full sentences. She received Lasix 40 mg IV and 20 mg IV 2 hours later, ASA 325 x 1, Zofran 8 mg IV, and 0.5     nitropaste. Initial vitals were T 98 P 93 BP 148/67  RR 24  93 % on 6 L and 100% on BiPap (brief).

Hematology Clinic Progress Note 

Fellow: Inge Logan, MD
Attending:  Cole Morgan, MD, PhD

Date of visit:  March 27, 2062

Diagnosis:  Mr. Goins is a 27 yoM with thrombocytosis here for interval follow-up on hydrea.

Hematologic History:
Mr. Goins is a 27 yo male with history of type I DM formally without regular medical care who was  visiting family in Maryland and had sudden witnessed seizure activity in late August.  At the time, blood sugar was >500.  Upon initial arrival to the ER in Maryland, he has BP 248/146; plt count was in 800's.  The patient was intubated, treated for HTN with labetolol and placed on IV insulin and dilantin  and transferred to BMH for further care.  

At BMH, brain MRI showed several small areas of infarct read as concerning for embolic CVA.  Embolic work-up included an echo which showed no vegetations, no PFO, NL EF with LVH; TEE without vegetations as well.  LP was done and sent for HSV which was negative.  He underwent a renal workup which showed nephrotic range proteinuria with labs also notable for rhabdoymyolysis.   Renal doppler US showed no sign of RAS.  He was continued on abx for his  aspiration PNA.  Other parts of the secondary hypertensive work-up were done including evaluation for hyperaldosteronism and pheochromocytoma.

The vent was weaned and he was extubated on the 4th.  HTN was controlled with labetolol drip with additional oral agents being added.  He continued to have intermittent fevers and was on broad antibiotics which were originally weaned off.

Hematologically, the hct and wbc fell as he was hydrated.   Plt count stayed stable in the 600's for several days before increasing on the 3rd gradually up to the 1000's.   Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were c/w ACD and he was started on epogen.  Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive (CRP was >150 with ESR >100).  He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable.  But his platelets kept climbing to nearly 1.5 million.  A bone marrow biopsy was done showing normal cytogenetics and no evidence for CML.  His bone marrow did demonstrate elevated megakaryocytes, concerning for a myeloproliferative process.  As well, he suffered a DVT in his subclavian/IJ on the same side as a central venous catheter.  Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count, he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital.  As well, hydrea was started at this time, initially at 500mg bid and then escalated to 1000mg bid when his counts were up to 800-900 despite the medication.  As well, he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer.  For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA.  He was discharged from the hospital in September.   

Since then he has been followed in hematology clinic.  Initially, his platelets were still in the hi 500's despite hydrea at 1000 bid.  His hematocrit was mildly depressed at this point as well (29-31%). He was re-evaluated on 12/05/61.  His platelets were 502,000.  An epo level was drawn and his hydrea was increased to 1500/1000mg.  He was re-evaluated on 12/26/61 and found to have a hematocrit of 26.2%, WBC of 2.7K, and platelets of 508,000.  His hydrea was decreased to 500mg bid. 

Interval History:
Since his last visit, he left for Wynne for one month.  When he returned, his creatinine had increased to 4.0.  A renal biopsy performed last week showed diabetic nephropathy.  He is being evaluated by Dr. Xing for dialysis and renal transplant evaluation.  

In terms of his blood disorders, the patient has been at his baseline fatigue, slightly improving over the past few months.  He has no fevers, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss.  He had one episode of transient global blurry vision 3 weeks ago which resolved on its own and has not recurred.  He has no headaches, other sensory deficits, or focal neurologic symptoms.  He has no oral ulcers or skin lesions from his Hydrea.

Skin:  scattered ulcerations on his arms with granulation tissue-stable,  scarred vesicular changes on his neck
Neuro: AOx3, able to ambulate without difficulty

Data:  See LMR.

Assessment and Plan:
Mr. Goins is a 27 yo male with insulin dependent diabetes and apparent untreated HTN who presented with seizure in setting of hypertensive emergency, subsequently found to have nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, and several small embolic-appearing strokes.  In this setting, he has developed marked thrombocytosis to 1.5 million and had subsequent provoked DVT.  He was treated with platelet pheresis, then hydrea.  It has been unclear if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs essential thrombocytosis.  We are following his CBC on hydrea.

His platelets are moderately elevated (757K).  He has no evidence of recurrent thrombosis.  His current hydrea dosing cannot be increased due to his anemia.  We would advise starting erythropoetin, monitoring his blood pressure closely.  At his current platelet count, his risk of thrombosis is not greatly increased, especially as his platelets are dysfunctional due to uremia.  We would advise continuing current hydrea. 

Continue current hydrea
Monitor counts monthly
Agree with starting erythropoetin in Internal Medicine. 
Return in 4 months for follow-up of counts

The patient was seen and discussed with Dr. Morgan.

Reason for Visit:  

taxotere weekly chemo



Diagnosis/Treatment Summary: 

Stage IVB (axillary and retroperitoneal LN and very large celiac axis LN mass) 

s/p XRT to esophagus

Renal vein thrombus on Coumadin 



History:  Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.  On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.  The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.  Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma. Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement. Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.  On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.  This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.  The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.  There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung. PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer. The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate. 



He remains quite asymptomatic with no weight loss or dysphagia.  He denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.  He has mild intermittant esophageal pain, usually after eating.  No bleeding. He does complain of baseline DOE, although no SOB at rest. He is fatigued.  Dizziness is improved with decrease in hypertension meds

After which, the patient had a trip to Peru and ran out of her medication 2 days priory to her return. When she returned about a wk ago the patient presented to EW because of another episode of hypertensive  emergency, for which, she was D/C with a follow up with one of the HGH PCPs. Patient could not get an appointment until later this month, and she was having a feeling of fatigue today, so she called her APS nurse which one more time found her to be in the 200s and sent her to the EW.

MD Connect Call 11:59pm 2/16/69 from Dr. Hale at Senior Care Clinic Queen Creek, SD regarding Terri Bird.  Patient admitted there 2/12/69 with CHF exacerbation with some associated COPD exacerbation and associated pneumonia.  All initially improved but then clinically worsening 2/14-2/16.  Patient requiring 100% NRB mask to maintain normal saturation with rising BUN/CR (hx kidney transplant).  Clinically showing pulmonary edema but no urine output to IV lasix.  Patient had established DNR status.  



Request by family to Dr. Hale to transfer patient to GCM.  I spoke to MD, nurse, and daughter-in-law and offered to accept patient when she was medically stabilized.  I thought she was too ill to safely transfer at the time without intubation before-hand.  



I called RN back at 6am and learned that patient had O2 saturation of 70%, pH=7.2 and covering MD had honored patient's established DNR order despite some family members desire to reverse it.  Patient too ill to transfer safely; will contact me again if patient stabilized.

The patient was seen in conjunction with resident, Dr. Anderson.

 PA's note was reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined by

me.  Please see the PA's note for details of the patient's past

medical, social, family history, review of systems, and physical

exam.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Rash on legs.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 79-year-old man brought in by his

family complaining of a pruritic rash on his bilateral ankles and

today, both ankles are slightly more swollen than usual.  He has

no difficulty breathing, no chest pain.  The patient used to live

in England 4 days ago, arrived in Frankenmuth to live now

permanently with his family here.  He has a history of ""heart

problems for which he is taking Lasix, enalapril, and amlodipine

and is compliant with these medications.  He says initially his

legs were not swollen.  It was only today that the family

happened to notice as he was complaining of a rash that he had

slightly increased swelling of these ankles bilaterally.  The

patient's daughter reports that she bought him new long underwear

and noticed that the rash began where the underwear elastic band

hit his ankles in that similar distribution, there is pruritus

with evidence of excoriation.  He also does have evidence of

chronic venous stasis changes in his legs.  The leg swelling is

equal bilaterally does not extend to the calf and is minimal. 

The patient reports that he coughs when he is out in the cold

Frankenmuth air, but does not produce any sputum.  Has baseline

orthopnea and PND of 3 pillows which has not changed.  He has had

no worsening shortness of breath and no chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, TIA.  He has

no history of DVT.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  No significant surgical procedures.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a past smoker, does not drink or use

drugs.  Lives with his family.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.

ALLERGIES:  Has no allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, in no distress,

afebrile.  Normal and stable vital signs, saturating 96-97% on

room air.  His exam is unremarkable except for excoriation to the

bilateral ankles with chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally

and trace 1-2+ edema bilaterally equal and the ankles only down

to the mid foot.  He has strong and equal, 2+ dorsalis pedis

pulses in the feet.  The rest of his examination is unremarkable

with clear lungs and breath sounds.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient said has no plans to

get a doctor in America.  He filled out an application

for Frankenmuth Care on arrival to the Emergency Department.  I spoke

with him and his family at length about the need to immediately

get a primary care doctor.  He was given the numbers for the

Tobey Hospital and Heritage Residence.  He has about 3 weeks of his

medications left and he is told that he will need to see ____. 

The family understands the urgency of this situation.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Today is dermatitis.  He is told to continue

his medications as prescribed to elevate the feet to decrease the

swelling.

DISPOSITION:  Discharged in satisfactory condition to follow up

with the primary care physician.

 January 25, 2151 (initial office note) Frank Caldwell:
	He is a 75 year old man who is referred by Dr. Freda Erickson of Mauston for consultation regarding a biopsy proven adenocarcinoma in the head of the pancreas. He apparently developed some twinge type pain in his right upper quadrant which he describes as    zingers    6 or 7 weeks ago. Work-up then involved imaging with a CT scan which I reviewed but do not have the written report on. This shows a mass in the head of the pancreas abutting and perhaps distorting the portal vein. He has not had any jaundice and does not have any change in his bowel functions. A subsequent endoscopic ultrasound examination confirms the mass in the head of the pancreas with features of portal vein invasion. Fine needle aspiration has confirmed adenocarcinoma. The mass itself is about 2   cm in diameter.
	His family history does not include any pancreatic cancer but his father had lung cancer.
	He denies smoking, drinking but exercises by walking about 5 days a week.
	His past surgical history includes a resection of an aortic aneurysm in 2131, cholecystectomy in 2131, prostatectomy for cancer in 2142 and resection of a lung cancer in 2143.
	His current medications include Lipitor 40mg a day, Glyburide 5mg three times a day (he has been taking it for 6     7 years), Lisinopril 5mg a day and a baby aspirin.
	He is said to be allergic to Sudafed and the dye used for CAT scans (the latter was apparently salivary gland swelling on the day following a CAT scan - - it is unclear whether the two are related).
	His review of systems also includes kidneys stones and spinal stenosis. He has had some mild recent weight loss. He denies symptoms of heart disease, neurologic disease or respiratory disease. His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
	I think he is not a candidate for attempted surgical resection at this time. With the findings consistent with portal vein invasion, he should first be treated with chemoradiation. He may be a candidate for subsequent surgery, probably not resection but perhaps intra-operative radiation therapy. I   ve explained this to him, his wife and daughter. After discussing the various alternatives we have agreed to have him evaluated in the Sawtooth Cancer Clinic for treatment planning for chemoradiation, with consideration of subsequent IORT. He comes from Elk Ridge and probably would prefer to have his treatment carried out at the Elk Ridge Health Center in coordination with us. This seems quite reasonable and we will proceed to set that up. I will also get a CA19-9 today and plan to see him at the completion of his chemoradiation.
	I spent 45 minutes in consultation and coordination of care.

Problems

Diabetes mellitus - cheated last weekend at a party, but mostly sugars 60-150s.  Last low-sugar rxn was a month ago, and her glyb. was decreased.  She may have ""polys"".  She still has not called her eye doctor for an appt. b/c too busy.  Urine microalbumin nl.  HBA1C 6.6%



Hypertension - did not increase atenolol as advised by Dr Buckley.  Her home BPs are 150/70, but her pulse is often in the 50s, which is why she is taking only 1/2 of atenolol.



Renal cancer : incidentally discovered, s/p nephrectomy



Hyperparathyroidism : ? 2/2 Vit D deficiency. Thyroid nodules.  Being evaluated by Dr Lawson, SH Endocrine.  However, the last time she went to Endo. she was told she did not have an appt. She has not rec'd another in the mail.  She never had the thyroid bx.  Last Ca nl. but phos low.



Dyspepsia/ H Pylori : unable to tolerate bismuth, TCN, metronidazole or clarithromycin and metronidazole.  She has occ. dyspepsia, for which she takes prn ranitidine, none lately.  Of note, recent guaiacs positive.  She had a colonoscopy 2079, which showed a polyp and diverticulosis.  Three year f/u rec.  Pt has been afraid to reschedule b/c was not sufficiently anesthetised the last time and had a lot of pain.



Plantar Fasciitis - resolved.



RHM - UTD.



SH - married.  Husband has some medical problems, but is able to drive her on all her errands, as she does not dirve. No cigs, EtOH, sexual activity.  She has 4 children and 9 grandchildren.  Her son was hit by a car some years ago, and sustained head trauma, now in assisted living.  She is very stressed all the time worrying about him.  She became tearful telling me about this.  Enjoys gardening and attending her quilting group.



ROS - + for hearing loss, diff. w/ memory related to stress and anxiety about son, as above in specific items, occ. constip.  Neg. otherwise.



PLAN:

Rev'd medical and SH. 

Re-refer to Dr Lawson, emailed Dr Lawson.

Disc. pt's intent about cancer surveillance.  She states that she would want to be treated if she had ca, and therefore agrees to upper and lower endo. if I request she receive adequate analgesia.

F/U 2 mo.  BP not done today b/c she became upset.  Prob. will need a third BP med, but not incr. bb.

Pulmonary Consult by Dr. Trujillo for management of PE

I have seen and examined the patient and agree with the history including HPI, PMHx, Meds, All, Family Hx, ROS; Pexam, labs, studies, assessment and plan as per Dr. Chavez.

Briefly, 78 YO female with recent hip fracture in 8/01 (not surgically repaired) who did well until 3 days PTA when she developed sudden onset CP, non-productive cough and was noted to have RA sat of 89%.  In ED, patient was hemodynamically stable.  CTPE protocol bilateral PE   s in both main PA   s and clot in LLE DV system.  Patient was started on UF heparin.  

PMHx notable for NSTEMI, diffuse CAD, left pleural mass followed by Fidious, COPD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, took coumadin after surgery 30 years ago 

Meds include:  Advair, Lipitor, HCTZ, heparin

Smoked 50 pk-years, quit 8 years ago.

Family hx notable for:  Son passed away in    01 with blood clots.

Pexam:
Sats 94% on 4L, T 98, P 78, BP 186/86 R 20
Gen Comfortable.
O/P Clear
Heart RRR no m/g/r
Lungs decreased BS throughout
Ext:  Superficial varicosities, minimal bilateral edema

Labs notable for:  WBC 15
Trop 0.22
Ntbnp 500

CT scan     multiple large central PE   s and bilateral upper and lower arteries; +emphysema; clot in left popliteal and distal and superficial femoral veins.

ECHO     EF 60%, mod TR RA dilation, RVSP>=54; RV hypokinetic, PFO with R   shunting   (increased RVSP, RA size since last ECHO)

Impression:

Large bilateral PE, hemodynamically stable
Evidence of RV strain, elevated cardiac enzymes, BNP which when combined put patient in risk group for increased mortality
Persistent DVT
PFO with right to left shunt
COPD

Recs:

Recommend retrievable IVC filter.  Rationale is that the patient has persistent clot in LE   s and has a PFO with right to left shunt and is at risk for CVA (though filter will not prevent small clots from embolizing) and that +cardiac enzymes, BNP, and ECHO place patient in risk group for increased mortality.
Do not recommend lytics in that patient is hemodynamically stable and risks for hemorrhage outweigh potential benefits in our opinion.
Can change to low molecular weight heparin.
Hypercoag w/u
Start spiriva, albuterol for COPD



Thanks for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient,

Patient was well until December 12th when she slipped on ice and fell on her left knee.  Patient initially noted an abrasion and some ecchymosis around the knee joint and been weight bearing without difficultly.  Patient reports frequent falls at home due to her neuropathy but is ambulatory without assist.  On December 19th, she noted some erythema around the knee joint and the lateral aspect of her shin and started developing pain and swelling that slightly limited her range of motion.  She also noted some knee stiffness.  Denies any drainage from injury site.  Patient did speak to the NP at her PCPs office and was advised to be evaluated in the ED.


ED course:  On arrival, the patient&#8217;s vitals were: 99.2 80 109/66 97%/RA.  Per report, a tap of the left knee was attempted but no fluid could be aspirated.

Record date: 2084-08-25

61 yo man with CAD and PVD referred by Dr. Short for pre-operative evaluation prior to vascular surgery.



He has a long hx of ischemic ulcer of the second toe of the right foot. He was admitted to the vascular service on 8/09 and had an arteriogram that showed complete occlusion of the SFA with reconstitution of the popliteal and single vessel run off. His pre-operative EKG raised the possibility of old ASMI although it was unchanged for a number of years. He underwent dobutamine MIBI which showed a moderate area of severe ischemia in the LAD territory. His LV was normal with EF of 59%. He underwent cath which showed complete occlusion of the LAD with collaterals from a fairly large diagonal that also had a tight stenosis. There were lower grade occlusions in the RCA territory and the LCX. He had been asymptomatic. The LAD lesion was long and totalled and not felt to be amenable to angioplasty. There were no indications to have him undergo CABG so the decision was made to PTCA the diagonal lesion to improve flow to the anterior wall. He tolerated this well. Returns today feeling well and has been active painting his fence and going up and down stairs without any chest pains or unusual SOB. Has had a hematoma in the groin.



MEDICATIONS:  Serevent.  Flovent.  Enalapril.  Colchicine. Alopurinol.

Albuterol.  Viagra.

 

ALLERGIES:  None. 

 

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died at 57 after his 8th MI.  He had his

first one at age 48.  Mother had a stroke in her early 50s.  His brother, Shields,

died a miserable death with recurrent, inoperable laryngeal cancer.

 

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married.  Continues to work as a sales representative.  He

has an adopted child, Xiao who is now 14 and doing very well in school. Quit smoking and drinking a number of years ago.

 



ROS: No chest pains. Chronic shortness of breath. No bowel problems. No bladder problems. Does not exercise. Last cholesterol was  175/42.     The rest of the review of systems was negative. 



PE: General: Looks well.

================ Vital signs ================

Blood Pressure:   150/80 142/80   130/78

Pulse:   84   [Regular, Radial]

Weight:   222   [Pounds]

Skin: Chronic ischemic ulcer on the medial aspect of his second toe of the right foot.

HEENT: EOMI. PEERL. No scleral icterus. Bilateral cataracts. Benign pharynx.

Neck: No lymphadenopathy. No thyromegaly. No cartotid bruits.

Lungs: Decreased breath sounds. Wheezes.

Cor: JVP is normal. PMI is not displaced. Heart sounds barely audible No murmurs. No gallops.

Abd: Normal bowel sounds. No hepatomegaly. No splenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness.

He has a small echymosis of the left inguinal area. Bilateral femoral bruits. 1+ right femoral pulse. I cannot palpate the left pulse.

Extremities: No pedal edema. Ulcer as above.



EKG done in the office shows NSR at 74. Axis 90. Normal intervals. He has Q's in V1-V2 c/w possible OASMI. He has low volts in the precordial leads c/w chronic pulmonary disease. No changes from previous.



================ Problems ================

PRE-OP EVALUATION   He has rest ischemia of the toe. He has three vessel coronary disease that is asymptomatic. There are no indications at this time to push for CABG. He underwent angioplasty to try to improve flow to the anterior wall. His EKG suggests OASMI but his ventriculogram is normal without evidence of MI and EF of 59%. There are studies showing increased risk of in-stent thrombosis, MI, death in patients who have had Plavix stopped for non-cardiac surgery within two weeks of stent. He will be beyond the two week period and Dr. Short is willing to operate on him while continuing Plavix and aspirin. I believe he is an acceptable risk for surgery.



PVD   Will need surgery for ischemic ulcer.



COPD   Doing well and is stable. Instructed to use his inhalers faithfully in the preop period.

       

GOUT    No flares this year.

      

HYPERTENSION    Better when rechecked. He gets nervous with the initial measurements.

      

IMPOTENCE         Discussed the fact that, now that he has documented CAD, there is increased risk with Viagra use. He understands that but indicates that he feels that for him personally the benefits outweigh the risks.

He had a adenosine stress test done in 11/47 which was negative for ischemia (lasting 5min and PDP of 13746). His last echo was done in 4/48 showed an EF of 59% presented to the health clinic with a 3 day hx of worsening L shoulder pain and episodes of diaphoresis. The shoulder pain is chronic and thought to be due to oa, and dm chor.He came to the clinic today for a BP check ( he is often hypotensive and orthostatic) and was noted to have TWI inferiorly and laterally on routine EKG.   He denied any chest pain, nausea, vomiting when he went to the e.r. 

In the e.r., his first set of cardiac enzymes was negative, he was also started on heparin IV, and given IV lopressor, and an aspirin. Of note, the patient had a bp up to 182/88. When the patient arrived on the floor he denied any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis. His BP was noted to be 228/105. 2.5 IV lopressor, 12.5 PO lopressor, and nitropaste were given initially to lower bp to 170/75.

	Reason for visit:
   Cardiology Admission note for + ETT


	Interval History:
   CC/ID: 60 yo female w/ CRFs of DM2, HTN, Chol admitted after +ETT.

HPI: The pt has not had any significant recent CV history.  When pressed, she notes that about 6 months ago, she had an episode of mild chest tightness while at rest which was not particularly severe nor was it exacerbated or relieved by any measures.  These sx occurred only once, and lasted for a ""few hours"" before abating.  She reports that she thought it might be ""heartburn,"" though she is not prone to dyspepsia.  Subsequently, she denies any exertional dyspnea, CP, jaw or arm pain, belching, post-prandial discomfort, ""heartburn"" or palpitations.  She has not had any sx of CHF including pnd, orthopnea or LE edema.  Moreover, she denies claudication (legs or arms).  She reports that she has a ""sedentary"" lifestyle, but still carries groceries, does laundry, and usual housework without limitation.  She presented to her PCP Dr. Ong for an annual physical recently and on ECG, he noted new inferior Q waves and referred her for ETT which she had today.  As noted below, she had an early positive ECG with NO symptoms of angina, but with marked light-headedness with STD and bigeminy lasting up to 20' into recovery.  Scans were notable for EF 51% with inferior HK and an inferior fixed defect and inferolateral ischemia.  She was then transferred to BH ED and here to MMC for angiography.

	Assessment and plan:
   60 yo female w/ panvascular disease with evidence of silent IMI with residual peri-infarct ischemia now w/ early + ETT with symptomatic L SC Steal during exertion (dizziness) along with coronary ischemia.  From a global perspective, she must have her coronary ischemia addressed with definitive assessment of her coronary anatomy given her high-risk ETT.  I have discussed the rationale, risks and benefits of diagnostic angiography, and she understands and is willing to proceed.  She understands that revascularization decisions will be dynamic and may include PCI or CABG (or medical rx).  She must also have aggressive secondary prevention measures instituted as well as a more deliberate assessment of her L SCA stenosis and steal syndrome, as this may in fact become overtly manifest should the L SCA stenosis worsen.

1) CAD: ASA 325mg daily, Statins to LDL&lt;70mg/dL, Low dose BB for now along with ACEI to R arm BP of 140s/80s for now.  NPO after midnight with plans for coronary angiography (+/- LSCA angiogram) and possibly renal angiography given severe hypertension and systemic atherosclerosis.  Will discuss with Drs. Harper/Kumar tomorrow.  Suggest LHC (cross valve), Cors, L SCA angio/gradient, LVG.  She does not seem to have any obvious contra-indications to DES (bleeding diathesis, upcoming procedures, etc)
2) L SCA stenosis with steal: Angiography will be the most expeditious way to evaluate the significance of this.  She denies arm claudication, but should she need the LIMA for CABG, the prox L SCA will need to be addressed.
3) Secondary prevention as above
4) DM: Will need medical rx on d/c.  Follow sugars while in house
5) PAD: Consider ABIs to establish baseline after d/c.

Record date: 2085-04-22

 
This patient wants to transfer his care from the McCook Erie Clinic to me. He 
got 
my name from a nurse who works in the hospital.  HE is a 58 year old white 
male retired Transportation Manager with a number of issues.  
1)  He had a cyst or a mass enlarge in his R submental region which was 
excised 
at the McCook Erie Clinic.  Note from his surgeon there said the path showed 
nonkaziating granuloma.  I hope cultures are pending.  The patient does 
volunteer at a homeless shelter so could  certainly be exposed to TB or 
atypical mycobacteria.  
2)  The patient has know mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation followed 
at the MEC by a cardiologist. He had a stress test in the last year that was 
benign. Never had CHF or endocarditis.  
3)  Social situation.  The patient is a sober alcoholic and sober for the 
last 
2 years however he went through divorce probably because of his alcoholism 
10 years ago and took early retirement from Brookdale Metro Systems because 
of his alcoholism. He stays sober by going to meetings and also 
volunteering at the McCook Clinic. He lives with a woman. He has good 
relations with his grown children and his grand children.  His woman friend 
is very supportive and the patient is now feeling good enough about himself 
that he is ready to try and get work full time.  Previous attempts to do so 
have resulted in failure because of his Hx of alcoholism and his premature 
retirement.
 
Family Hx. Father died at age 79 of Altzheimers and some kind of cancer ? 
throat cancer.  His mother had diabetes and coronary artery disease and she 
died of colon cancer. The patient himself had a colonoscopy within the last 
year and it was normal.  One brother and 2 sisters, one of the sisters also 
has mitral valve disease. 
 
Past medical Hx the alcoholism and he was stabbed in the L hand I think in 
2059 and that was repaired. He also had a TNA in childhood. 
 
He has no known allergies to medications.
 
The only medication he takes is Lisinopril 5 mg for blood pressure. He was 
only started on this in the last year. He also takes a vitamin a day.
 
His other significant medical complaint is erectile dysfunction.  He has 
normal libido and good sexual drive however he tends to lose erection after 
he 
has gone for a few minutes.  He can achieve vaginal penetration.  His live in 
lover has been supportive but she would like him to have better performance 
and so would he. He does wake up in the morning frequently with erections. He 
has no known Hx of diabetes.  No prolonged hypertension or vascular disease.  
 
Social Hx.  The patient eats fairly well. He walks usually a mile or so a 
day.  
He does not do any aerobic activity. He does smoke  to a pack a day and has 
for many, many years.  He does wear seat belts when he drives and does not do 
any elicit drugs.  On system review:  Weight stable.  No change in skin. He 
always had a very gravelly voice.  He has had no change in his vision. He is 
very deaf in the L ear.  He has a morning cough no hemoptysis.  Cough is 
about 
a teaspoon of white/gray sputum. He has no dyspnea on exertion.  He has no 
angina.  No palpitations.  No presyncope or syncope.  NO claudication. He has 
no dysphagia. He has no epigastric discomfort.  No change in his bowel 
movements and no rectal bleeding.  He has no claudication.  No edema and no 
joint pains. No headaches and no low back pain.  No long bone pain.  He has 
no 
heat or cold intolerance.  He has no easy bruisability.  
 
PE: shows him to 5'7"".  155 lbs.  Skin benign.  Nails do show some early 
clubbing. No cyanosis.  Normal no AV knicking.  Flat disks. Pupils equally 
round and reactive to light and accommodation at 3 mm. Nares normal.  TMs 
normal. Hearing is markedly diminished in the L ear. Head is normal cephalic. 
Thyroid not enlarged.  There is the scar at the site of his excision under 
the 
mandible. No associated adenopathy on either R or L neck or axilla or the 
supraclavicular region.  He is hyperesonant to percussion.  He has distant 
breath sounds. No rales, rhonchi or wheezes. He has normal S1.  Normal S2 and 
holosystolic blowing 2-3/6 mid systolic murmur radiates best to the axilla. 
No 
radiation to the clavicles. No carotid bruits.  Jugular venous pulsation to 7 
sonometers. Abdomen is soft and non tender. There is no enlargement of the 
liver. No adeventitious masses. There is a L inguinal weakness without frank 
hernia.  Phallus uncircumsized. Testes normal. Prostate is a little difficult 
feel because he has a band around the anal sphincter which makes it difficult 
for me to get beyond but I felt probably half of his prostate and it was 
normal and smooth. Stool was guac negative. Reflexes 3+ and equal throughout 
and normal vibratory sense and touch. Normal gait and station.
 
Assessment and Plan:
 
1)  Recent rapidly growing mass under the R mandible showing nonkaziating 
granuloma.  Culture is pending and we will plant a PPD and control early 
next week. I will have him tracked down the report of this from the MEC and 
get culture reports and will get chest x-ray today both for his COPD to 
rule out a cavitary lesion.  
2)  Alcoholism now sober.
3)  Erectile dysfunction try Viagra. He was given appropriate warnings and 
instructions.  I gave him 100 mg # 7.  
4)  Mitral valve prolapse by auscultation followed by cardiologist at the MEC.
5)  We spent a long time talking about smoking cessation.  He has some 
Wellbutrin at home from when he was depressed while getting sober and I 
encouraged him to take 150 b.i.d. and we made a plan for him to try and 
quit.   I will see patient again next week to plant a PPD and then see him 
again in about a month to see how he is doing.  We will certainly check the 
chest x-ray to make sure he did not have active cavitary disease.

Visit Note (unreviewed)



Reason for visit   f/u for inpatient consult - GBS AV endocarditis



History of present illness   See initial ID consult note for greater detail. Briefly, 70 yo F w HTN, DM2, stable angina who is transferred to NSH on 4/3/89 with aortic valve endocarditis complicated by AI and CHF. She was in her USOH until ~2/8/89 when she had an episode of shingles on R arm for which she took Valtrex. Soon after she began to feel fatigued and febrile and was found to have a 2/2 bottles positive for Group B streptococcus on 2/21 (PCN MIC 0.125) for which her PCP treated her with 2 week course of amoxicillin. On 4/3 she presents with SOB, orthopnea, and PND. she developed DOE, PND, orthopnea, worsening fatigue and malaise. CXR at OSH notable for pulm edema and TTE demonstrated vegetation on the aortic valve. 



She was transferred to NSH where she was started on ampicillin 1gm IV q8h and gentamicin 120 mg TID. TTE 4/4 showed a mobile mass of echoes attached to the valve c/w vegetation. The right coronary leaflet appears flail, and there was prolapse of the non-coronary cusp as well. There was evidence of at least moderate aortic insufficiency by color and spectral Doppler. She went to the OR on 4/5 CABG, TEE, Homograft aortic root placement oIn the OR the aortic valve was severely damaged. There was perforation of the right coronary leaflet and there were numerous vegetations, which appeared to be rolled up aortic valve tissue on predominantly the right and noncoronary leaflets. Underneath the annulus of the right coronary, there was an area of early abscess 

formation. Gram stain of tissues was negative for organisms and cultures were negative. Pathology was notable for Numerous degenerated bacterial coccal forms present on silver stain consistent with Streptococcus. Occasional residual gram positive cocci present on Brown-Hopps stain. 



She was started on PCN 3 million units q4h and Gentamicin 60 mg q12h on 4/6. Her hospital course was c/b by heart block for which she received a PPM on 4/12. She has now completed 6 weeks of PCN on 5/20 and 2 weeks of gentamicin (4/6-4/20). She is clinically doing well without fevers, chills, night sweats, drainage or erythema from sternal incision or from PICC site. She does note swelling of her R arm which is slightly worse since she has been unable to wear her sleeve for chronic lymphedema. 





She had a recent admission 5/11-5/15 for chest pain. She was ruled out for MI by cardiac markers and underwent cardiac catheterization which showed patent graft. 



Past medical history   1. Stable Angina (prior cath in 2073 reportedly normal) 

2. HTN 

3. DM2 

4. GERD 

5. S/P Bilateral Mastectomy - R in 2081 and L in 2084 

6. S/P Right Carotid Endarterectomy 

7. Back surgery with rods placed 2088 at MSTMC

Neurology MEDIQUIK Senior Note



9/26/75

5:00AM

Patient Name: Percy Carrillo

MRN: 1668727



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Please see neurology PGY2 note for full details. In brief the patient is a 62 yo man with mental retardation, HTN, hyperlipidemia, head trauma with SDH with evacuation, DM who presents with gait instability and difficulty with speaking and swallowing. Per guardian the patient was in his USOH until 9/24/75 evening at approximately 8:30pm he was found to have mumbled speech and having difficulty with ambulation with leaning to the left. On 9/25/75 in the morning he had a fall when getting out of bed and struck his head, and brought to the ED. No prior history of stroke or TIA. 



MEDS: ASA, Metformin, Glyberide, Tegretol, Fosinoperil, Lipitor, HCTZ

			

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

VITALS: 	BP 130/85

MS:	AA&Ox3, speech fluent with slurring (unclear baseline), repeats and names well.  Comprehends simple commands.  Names president

CN: 	PERRL, VF full with BTT. EOMI but with nystagmus in all directions of gaze, even primary gaze. Facial sensation intact.  Face asymmetric. Tongue, palate symmetric.  SCM and traps 5/5. 

Motor:	UMN pattern weakness in RUE (4-/5), most notable in hands. Mild  proximal RLE weak (4+/5).  

Coord:	Impaired FTN in LUE, intact in RUE.   

Refl:	Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ at biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patella, and ankles.  Plantar response is flexor on right and extensor on left.             

Sens:              Decreased PP but NOT LT in LUE and LLE 



Imaging: 

MRI Brain (9/25/75)     DWI bright ADC dark right lateral medullary pyramid with associated increased T2 signal.

MRA Head/Neck (9/25/75)     Narrowing of basilar artery with flow signal throughout and no thrombosis  

CTA Head/Neck (9/25/75)     Diffuse atherosclerotic disease, occluded R-ICA with good collateralization of right hemisphere, severe irregular narrowing through out bilateral vertebral arteries and basilar arteries. 



IMPRESSION: The patient has numerous risk factors for stroke with HTN, DM2, and HLP. His exam is consistent with lateral medullary pyramid lesion with involvement of spinalcortical tract prior to decussation explaining ipsilateral weakness and also involvement of the spinalthalamic tract explaining contralateral deficit in pain sensation. His vessel imaging is notable and concerning for diffuse atherosclerotic disease, specifically in posterior circulation in distribution of acute stroke. The patient was reportedly taking aspirin, though reports are mixed and this needs clarification. Vessel imaging did not implicate that the patient suffered from acute vertebro-basilar thrombo-embolism, but that his posterior circulation disease is a chronic issue and the stroke was more likely due to distal vessel thrombosis. Anticoagulation can be considered in acute setting of small sized posterior circulation stroke with vertebro-basilar disease, but in this case by the time the patient became known to neurology service and by the time it was known he had a stroke it was some 24hrs after initial symptoms, and in this interval he did not show any signs or symptoms of stroke progression making unstable plaque unlikely. Given the findings of the WASID study that anticoagulation did not significantly improve recurrent stroke prevention benefits over aspirin for symptomatic vertebro-basilar disease (because warfarin benefits were offset by higher hemorrhage rates), the decision to place this patient on aspirin is supported. The long term management of this patient requires aggressive control of atherosclerotic risk factors such as HTN, DM2, and HLP. The patient is significantly at risk of major ischemic stroke due to occluded right carotid artery and diffuse posterior circulation disease, and it is conceivable that if he continues to have persistent symptoms in the future that a revascularization procedure may be necessary.   



RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.	Aspirin 325 mg po qd

2.	Continue Lipitor 

3.	HTN management as an outpatient, autoregulate x 24hrs for SBP<180 mmHg  

4.	DM2 management 

5.	Check lipids, homocysteine, lipoprotein a, hba1c

6.	Check TCDs to obtain baseline data

7.	Consider TTE/Holter as outpatient as unlikely this was a cardioembolic event

Original ID Consult: 4/6/89
Sign off Date: 4/14/89

ID issues : GBS AV endocarditis

Brief History:  See initial ID consult note for greater detail.  Briefly, 70 yo F w HTN, DM2, stable angina who is transferred to NSH on 4/3/89 with aortic valve endocarditis complicated by AI and CHF.   She was in her USOH until ~2/8/89 when she had an episode of shingles on R arm for which she took Valtrex.  Soon after she began to feel fatigued and febrile and was found to have a 2/2 bottles positive for Group B streptococcus on 2/21 (PCN MIC 0.125) for which her PCP treated her with 2 week course of amoxicillin.  On 4/3 she presents with SOB, orthopnea, and PND.  she developed DOE, PND, orthopnea, worsening fatigue and malaise.  CXR at OSH notable for pulm edema and TTE demonstrated  vegetation on the aortic valve.   

She was transferred to NSH where she was started on  ampicillin 1gm IV q8h and gentamicin 120 mg TID.  TTE 4/4 showed a mobile mass of echoes attached to the valve c/w vegetation.  The right coronary leaflet appears flail, and there was prolapse of the non-coronary cusp as well.  There was evidence of at least moderate aortic insufficiency by color and spectral Doppler.   She went to the OR on 4/5 CABG, TEE, Homograft aortic root placement oIn the OR the aortic valve was severely damaged. There was perforation of the right  coronary leaflet and  there were numerous vegetations, which appeared to be rolled up aortic valve tissue on predominantly the right and noncoronary leaflets. Underneath the annulus of the right coronary, there was an area of early abscess
formation.   Gram stain of tissues was negative for organisms and cultures were negative.  Pathology was notable for Numerous degenerated bacterial coccal forms present on silver stain consistent with Streptococcus.  Occasional residual gram positive cocci present on Brown-Hopps stain.

She was started on PCN 3 million units q4h and Gentamicin 60 mg q12h on 4/6 with plan to  complete 6 weeks of PCN, and 2 weeks of genatmicin.  

Her hospital course was c/b by heart block for which she received a PPM on 4/12.

Recommendations:  
Gentamicin 60 mg IV q12h)  will end on 4/20
Please check gent peak/trough early next week. ( goal peak 3-5, trough <1)
PCN 3 million units q4h until 5/18

the odor of alcohol on her breath.  HEAD:  Atraumatic.  NECK:  Full 
range of motion, non-tender.  CHEST:  Clavicles and chest were 
non-tender.  LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.  HEART:  Normal S1 and 
S2.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and non-tender.  PELVIS & EXTREMITIES: 
Unremarkable with the exception of the right ankle, which is in a 
plaster splint.  When removed laceration was seen just proximal to 
the medial malleolus.  There was a normal pulse and capillary 
refill in the extremity. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  X-rays revealed a fracture underlying the 
laceration of the tibia.  There was also a distal fibular fracture 
as well.  The mortise appeared intact.  Chest x-ray was clear. 
Electrocardiogram is pending.  Laboratory studies showed a normal 
CBC, glucose of 291, and creatinine of 1.9 from the other facility. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient will be taken to the 
operating room for wash-out and open reduction and internal 
fixation procedure. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Open tib-fib fracture. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 
presently in stable condition.

Oroville, AL  89389                    48423663

(468) 429-7459                     06/14/2080





HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old male who returns to the clinic for a followup visit.  The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  He also had an episode of bronchitis about 2 months ago, which was treated with antibiotics.  The patient feels improved today



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  An elderly male in no acute distress.  Blood pressure is 142/90 and pulse is 64.  Chest is clear bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Positive S1 and S2.  Negative S3 and S4.  No murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Lower extremities, no edema, nontender.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Diabetes mellitus.  The patient reports blood sugars which have ranged from 106-158 and reports overall good control of his diabetes mellitus.  We will continue current treatment, especially in view of the fact that his most recent hemoglobin A1c in February was 6.1 and repeat hemoglobin A1c when he returns for his next visit.

2.  Hypertension.  The patient's atenolol was recently decreased from 50 mg to 25 mg because of bradycardia and lisinopril was increased to 60 mg because of microalbuminuria.  The patient's heart rate is appropriate at 64 even though his blood pressure remains borderline elevated.  We will check a microalbumin today.

4.  Recent TSH was mildly suppressed and we will repeat this today.

5.  Regular healthcare maintenance.  A CT of the patient's chest will be repeated when he returns for his next visit as recommended by radiology.

 BMH Senior Health Initial Visit

CC: 79 yo man hx depression, psychosis, insomnia, CAD, syncope, HTN, DMT2, carotid stenosis, PVD, here for PCP and f/u of these and other chronic health problems

HPI: Patient recently presented to BMH with syncope s/p standing abruptly leading to left forhead lac. No seizure activity. He was brought to BMH where he indicated he had had 2 similar episodes in previous month. 
Concern for cardiac orig1n given lack of posterior fossa signs, orthostasis at BMH, hx of seizure symptoms, and significant trauma. He ruled out for MI, had TTE showing EF 59% but had inf. WMA and LA dilation. Cardiology was therefore consulted. An adenoMIBI stress test was later performed and revealed mild inf. lat reversible ischemia, therefore a LHCath was performed and showed moderate non-intervenable lesions in the RCA and distal PLV. The patient also underwent an EP study that was non-diagnostic. An implantable loop recorder was placed on 6/21. Other work up of syncope included CNIs showing mild RICA stenosis; neurology consult thought these findings were unlikely to be the cause of his syncope and agreed with continued evaluation of cardiac etiologies.
    
In hospital, was noted that pt had had 40 lb weight loss over previous months. Surgery was consulted regarding prompt need for intervention of a known hernia, their evaluation was that the hernia was benign without signs of obstruction and there was no need for inpatient intervention. Endocrine w/u included nl TSH and cortstim. The patient had had a recent Chest and Abd CT and colonoscopy that had no evidence of pancreatic or colonic massess. SPEP and BNP wnl and; his PSA was elevated at 9.56, however alk phos, bone survey, bone scan were all normal. The patient's nutrition and PO intake improved greatly s/p treatment for constipation with an aggressive bowel regimen. 
   
Just prior to d/c, after returning from an uncomplicated EP study the patient started to exhibit inappropriate behavior (showing stool when not requested to staff) and stating bizarre thoughts (""I lost my mortal soul""). Psychiatry was consulted and suspected the patient was having a psychotic episode in setting of prolonged
hospitalization and multiple diagnostic interventions. It was concluded that an inpatient geri-psych hospitalization was required.

Hospitalization done on Psych floor. Per psych eval, pt had been withdrawn and depressed for 8 months with poor sleep, anhedonia, and decreased energy. The pt believed that he had died some time ago and was currently in hell. He stated that he had been feeling that he had sinned so horribly, that God could not forgive him. He stated that he had died, and then further stated that by this he meant that though he might be     physically alive, because he could not be forgiven, he was for all intents and purposes, spiritually dead. He had been having vivid dreams and had been told that he had exalted himself above god and for that would be punished.
           
On the inpt ward, Mr. Shepherd was started on zyprexa 5 mg which was titrated up to a dose of 20 mg qHS. Cymbalta was initiated and titrated up to 60mg qDay with gradual and signficant improvement in his mood.  The patient also expressed difficulty sleeping which responded to Remeron 15mg. At the time of discharge, the patient reported good appetite, adequate sleep (about 8 hours a night, occasional awakening with nocturia), and significant improvement of his depression.  He further noted that his thoughts of being doomed to hell were still occasionally present, though much less intense than upon admission, and he reported that he was able to  challenge this belief ""most of the time.

Neuropsych testing performed during inpt stay showing significant cognitive impairment. He had global deficits in language, memory, visual-spatial abilities, executive functioning, and attention. He had very poor learning of new information.      
     
Pt was discharged to home with an intake appointment in the Jones Hospital
Psychiatry scheduled for the following day.

He has since followed up with Frances Talley, where Zyprexa dose slowly tapered to decrease grogginess. 
 
Today, patient reports improved mood, no longer feels down, no longer feels guilty, as though in hell. Has continued to taper down Zyprexa to 3.75mg QHS. Saw Dr. Nobles on Wednesday, felt that patient should continue to stay on low dose Zyprexa for now. Pt as fell has been tapering down Cymbalta as well, taking it QOD.

Reports some intermittent aches in right groin secondary to inguinal hernia. Awaiting appt with Dr. Small -- Sept 15th.

Ms. Westyn-Nuel returns following myocardial infarction with
stenting procedure in February of this year. She continues to do
well and had an LDL of 90 in March. We will recheck it again today. 
She has no significant chest discomfort and is doing all of her
activities.  She has no syncope or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
She is tolerating her medications quite well and is happy with her
progress.  At home she takes her blood pressure and it's generally 
around 120/80.
 
Current medications are one aspirin per day as well as Isordil 20
mg. t.i.d., Labetalol 400 mg. t.i.d., Norvasc 7.5 mg. q.d., Lipitor
80 mg. q.d. and Glipizide.  She has not used sublingual
Nitroglycerin although she has this.  
 
Her blood pressure today is 128/80 and her heart rate is 50 and
regular.  Chest is clear. Cardiac exam reveals a II/VI left sternal
border systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen is soft and nontender. 
Extremities are free of edema.
 
Ms. Kelli Westyn-Nuel is doing well. We will check her LDL
again today to make sure it did not rebound to a higher level
following her myocardial infarction.  We will also check her liver
function test because of her statin therapy.  We may in the future
need to adjust her nitrates to a more rational once per day
regimen, but her current situation is so stable that we will leave
her medications as is.

Major Problems

Coronary artery disease

History of CAD w/ positive ETT 3/37 (nothing on PCIS); since then had neg adeno-MIBI in 2145, 2147, 8/48 (but only 9680 PDP). Pt on asa, mevacor with hi chol (last fasting 7/48 chol 214, LDL 128). TTE 4/48: EF 59%, LVH, mild MR, no SWMA. Cards = Mildred Gustafson. 

A/P: Cath pending. Cont ASA. Would recheck fasting cholesterol and change to lipitor 80 qd for maximal risk factor management. Limited in use of BB, ACE with orthostatic hypotension. 

Orthostatic hypotension

Fairly severe orthostasis, likely secondary to autonomic dysfunction from diabetes.  Continues to c/o dizziness + nausea with prolonged standing. On fludrocortisone 1x/d, midodrine 10 TID, occ wearing TED stockings. 

A/P: Encourage H2O intake. Needs TED stockings. Continue fludrocortisone 0.1 mg/d, may need to decrease midodrine.

Renal insufficiency

Patient has a h/o DM and CRI. Baseline Cr ranges from 2-3, but went as low as 1.4 in the hospital with hydration. Est CrCl around 28. Ulytes c/w renal disease. Nephrologist Dr. Nesmith. He tries he drinks 6 8 oz glasses of water qd but sometimes doesn't drink as much as that. 

A/P: Encourage hydration, IVF + mucomyst o/n pre cath.

Assessment and plan   1. CAD: NSTEMI, on ASA, heparin, statin. 2b3a to start, cath pending in AM. Would recheck fasting cholesterol and change to lipitor 80 qd for maximal risk factor management. Be VERY CAUTIOUS in use of BB, ACE with orthostatic hypotension (he has supine HTN but is extremely orthostatic when he stands up).

- cards consult appreciated

- bedrest x 24h

- increase BB; hold ACE with pending cath.

- pls repeat TTE as per cards

- fasting chol pending; inc lipitor to 80 qd.

4. DM: on  Insulin 75/25, 28 qA, 26qP. Continue QID FS, adjust as needed. Pls resend HbA1c and get a nutrition consult. I am concerned that he is on too much regular insulin causing his nightsweats and his low glc at FCH yesterday. He may need to change back to NPH and regular (was difficult in the past 2/2 poor vision and arthritis).



5. constipation: pls increase bowel regimen (currently on miralax + colace).



6. PT consult please. He will likely need rehab.



Thanks for the excellent care! I will continue to follow with you.

Yearly visit 63 yo man with PVD and COPD.



If he has to walk a long distance gets an aching pain in the left calf. ABI is .78 on that side. Has been coughing for a month. Yellow sputum. Has not gone on steroids. Every year this happens once. Viagra is working sometimes at 50 sometimes at 100. Apparently bone packing did not have the desired result of his cystic lesion but he tolerates this.



PMH:

He has a long hx of ischemic ulcer of the second toe of the right foot. He was admitted to the vascular service on 8/09/84 and had an arteriogram that showed complete occlusion of the SFA with reconstitution of the popliteal and single vessel run off. His pre-operative EKG raised the possibility of old ASMI although it was unchanged for a number of years. He underwent dobutamine MIBI which showed a moderate area of severe ischemia in the LAD territory. His LV was normal with EF of 59%. He underwent cath which showed complete occlusion of the LAD with collaterals from a fairly large diagonal that also had a tight stenosis. There were lower grade occlusions in the RCA territory and the LCX. He had been asymptomatic. The LAD lesion was long and totalled and not felt to be amenable to angioplasty. There were no indications to have him undergo CABG so the decision was made to PTCA the diagonal lesion to improve flow to the anterior wall. He tolerated this well. 



MEDICATIONS:  Serevent.  Flovent.  Enalapril.  Colchicine. Alopurinol.

Albuterol.  Viagra. Aspirin. 

 

ALLERGIES:  None. 

 

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died at 57 after his 8th MI.  He had his

first one at age 48.  Mother had a stroke in her early 50s.  His brother, Shields,

died a miserable death with recurrent, inoperable laryngeal cancer.

has an adopted child, Xiao who is now 15 and doing very well as an honor student. She is going to the Summer Institute for the Gifted. He quit smoking and drinking a number of years ago.

 

ROS: No chest pains. Chronic shortness of breath. No bowel problems. No bladder problems. Off exercise since fracture.  The rest of the review of systems was negative.

Interim History:	

Comes to review her medical problems.



She had been losing weight and feeling fatigued. She has been at her current weight for several weeks and feels that she has stabilized. Appetite has been good. 



Home Blood Tests:  No records. She reports that she drops from the 200's to the normal range in the morning. Her bedtime test is about 3-4 hours after summer.  

Retinopathy:	Saw Dr. Xiques in the Spring. May need laser for p-cataract film. Retinas stable.

Nephropathy:	Cr 1.0 in September. Saw Dr. Caldwell re her Charcot foot. He put her in a boot and wheelchair for 3 weeks and it resolved well. 

Cardiac:	Gets little tingling sensations in her anterior chest, occurring at any times. Not specifically at times of physical exercise. 

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Medications: Prograf reduced.



Review of Systems: 

GI: Feels that her abdomen is uncomfortable much of the time. Not precipitated or relieved by food. Upper and lower abdominal. No change in volume or nature of ileostomy output. She has dysphagia for liquids, sometimes with regurgitation. 

Had Pap and mammogram through ANC gynecologist.

She saw Dr. Wilhelm for sinus problems. He got an MRI. It showed a meningioma of the jugular foramen. Dr. Wilhelm's note indicated that she would see Dr. New for that and indeed she has seen Dr. New, although she says it is for a tumor on the vocal cord. 

He also wanted her to see Dr. Carter about a vocal cord paralysis, and that visit is upcoming. 





Physical Exam:	

Looks well.

BP:   118/70		P:   72, regular

Wt:   118.5 without shoes, down 8.5

HEENT:	Anicteric. 

Carotids:	Normal pulses, without bruits

Chest:	Clear to auscultation

Heart:	Dyskinetic prominent apical impulse. Normal S1; single S2.  S4.  2/6 systolic ejection murmur

Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. Small epigastric hernia with mild tenderness in that area. Ileostomy. No palpable AAA. 

Extremities:	No edema.       DP 2+,=.  PT absent. Prominent mound of tissue in the plantar aspect of L foot, from Charcot changes, but with very normal skin covering.  Good foot care.



Impressions and Plan:	

Many active issues.

Hard to assess control without data. Must bring them to visits.

For now, reduce the Lantus to 8 U since she drops overnight by history.

Will need to talk with Dr. Wilhelm and Dr. New about their respective perspectives and figure out who is addressing the meningioma and hydrocephalus. May need to see a neurologist. 

Refer to Dr. Sanders for evaluation of her gastrointestinal discomfort and dysphagia for liquids. I suspect a motility disorder.

She needs follow-up with Dr. Arndt. 

1 hour; most counseling and coordination of care.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 65-year-old female who presents today for hospital followup.



I admitted her to the HH on 10/03/79 with an episode of hypoxemia, which was felt to be secondary to CHF and diastolic dysfunction.  She was discharged to johnson rest home on 10/12/79.  Two hours after arrival, she had a respiratory arrest and was taken to the Intensive Care Unit at Clinica Rovira where she stayed until 11/03/79.  She is extremely difficult to diurese because of her tenuous renal function, this required multiple adjustments of her medication.  Stress test showed no ischemia and echocardiogram showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal chamber size and systolic function, estimated ejection fraction is 65% as well as biatrial enlargement .  She did well acutely with BiPAP and remains on oxygen.  As part of her workup, she had pulmonary function tests, which showed moderate obstruction without a bronchodilator response and some mild restriction likely due to her obesity.  In addition, she was quite anemic with hematocrit of 19 on presentation.  There was no evidence of hemolysis.  She is mildly iron deficient and colonoscopy showed a tubulovillous adenoma, which was excised as well as  a short area of Barrett's esophagus.  There was no evidence of active bleeding.  She received multiple transfusions throughout her stay and was started on darbepoetin, for what was ultimately felt to be anemia of renal disease.  She was discharged to Lahey Clinic and has just returned home.  Her son, Brendon Ambrose who was the healthcare proxy, is here with her today.



Today, she feels reasonably well.  She is still somewhat weak from the prolonged hospitalization, but is quite enthusiastic about the fact that she lost 30 pounds.  She is taking her medications regularly and remains on 2 liters of oxygen.  She has no chest pain or shortness of breath.  Her diabetes regimen was changed during the hospital, she is still taking 70/30 insulin, but lower dose in the evenings and using a sliding scale of lispro insulin with meals.



Hospital course was complicated by a hospital-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infection as well.  



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure secondary to diastolic dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine approximately 3, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral neuropathy, Barrett's esophagus, colon polyps (tubulovillous adenoma 2079), diverticulosis adenoid hypertrophy, humeral fracture, history of marijuana use, history of alcohol abuse.



MEDICATIONS:  Reconciled today, they include:

1.  Aspirin 81 mg daily.

2.  Calcium plus D 1 tablet b.i.d.

3.  Darbepoetin is followed by Dr. Dougherty at St. Mary's.

4.  Iron sulfate 325 mg b.i.d.

5.  Hydralazine 100 mg t.i.d.

6.  Loratadine 10 mg daily.

7.  Metolazone 100 mg daily.

8.  Metoprolol succinate 150 mg daily.

9.  Multivitamin.

10.  Nitroglycerin patch 0.3 mg per hour (3 x 0.1 mg patches).

11.  70/30 NovoLog 60 units in the morning and 35 in the evening.

12.  Omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d.

13.  Potassium chloride 40 mEq t.i.d.

14.  Ropinirole 0.25 mg daily.

15.  Simvastatin 40 mg daily.

16.  Spiriva 1 inhalation daily.

17.  Spironolactone 50 mg daily.

18.  Torsemide 100 mg b.i.d.

19.  Trazodone 25 mg nightly.

20.  B-complex vitamin daily.

21.  Vitamin D3 1000 units daily.

22.  Coumadin as monitored by the Hematology Dept..



ALLERGIES TO MEDICATIONS:  None.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 136/60, pulse 74, temperature 97, and weight 222 pounds.  General appearance:  She looks remarkably well given everything she has gone through.  HEENT is unremarkable.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy, no JVD.  Lungs are clear.  Heart irregularly irregular without murmurs.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, without organomegaly.  Extremities without edema.



LABORATORIES:  Drawn by the VNA on 01/04/80 shows hematocrit of 28.6, INR 2.1 on December 9, 2079 as well as potassium 3.9 and creatinine 3.2.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Congestive heart failure, diastolic dysfunction.  She is currently euvolemic with a weight of 222 pounds.  She will check daily weights.  I will speak to Dr. Vandiver, her cardiologist whom she is seeing next week about getting her enrolled in the HH Cardiac Rehab Center.  Meanwhile, she will call me for any fluctuations in weight.

2.  Atrial fibrillation, stable and rate controlled.  Coumadin anticoagulation followed by the HH Hematology Department.

3.  COPD, for now, she remains on Spiriva and Flovent as well as oxygen 2 liters per minute.  We will see how she does; she may benefit from a trial of Advair.

4.  Chronic renal insufficiency.  Creatinine at baseline of 3.2.  She will need to be watched closely.  She expressed interest in possibility of her renal transplant should that become necessary.  There has been a question as to whether she has renal artery stenosis based on a Doppler ultrasound done during rehabilitation.  I think this must have been done at Brookwood Hospital because no studies are available in the HH system.  Dr. Dougherty had done MRA a number of years ago, which showed no renal artery stenosis at that time, but her worsening renal function is new.  She is scheduled to see Dr. Dougherty next week and will follow up with her expressly raising this issue.  Her son brought up the issue of perhaps consolidating all her care at the HH ,in particular is seeing a nephrologist here.  She is quite fond of Dr. Dougherty who has cared for her for years, but I think given the complexity of medical care.  this might not be a bad idea.  She is going to discuss with Dr. Dougherty and I will E-mail Dr. Dougherty as well.

5.  GI.  She was noted to have Barrett's esophagus and tubulovillous adenoma on exam and she will need to have followup within 1 year for this.

6.  Heme.  Her anemia is a combination of iron deficiency and anemia of renal disease.  She needed several transfusions during the hospitalization.  She is scheduled to see Hematology at Stone-Wheeling in January.  In the meantime,  I have spoken to Dr. Dougherty who agrees to monitor her in the Renal Department at St. Mary's.  If necessary, they can give her intravenous iron.  I will check a hematocrit and iron stores today and fax them over to Dr. Dougherty.

7.  Health care maintenance.  Labs today.  H1N1 vaccine today.  Son, Brendon Ambrose is her healthcare proxy and I have put his name in the Advanced directive file on the LMR.  She wishes to be full code at present.  I will see her again in 4 weeks.



Visit length 60 minutes.

Internal Medicine Intern Admission Note

PATIENT:  Umstead, Kenneth
MRN:  9544546
ADMIT DATE: 7/02/84 
ATTENDING: Vernon Toth
PCP:  Vernon Toth
CONTACT:  Valeria Umstead (056) 216-7457

CC:  lethargy, increasing disorientation x2 weeks

HPI:  
Mr Umstead is an 87yo M with h/o Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathy (s/p CEA, known PVD) who presents after two weeks of increased lethargy, increasing disorientation and visual hallucinations.

Per his wife who acts as his primary caretaker, Mr Umstead was in his USOH until about two weeks ago, when she began noticing increased lethargy and confusion.  He developed gait instability and began confusing family members with each other, and being confused about whether the house he was in was his own.  This increased in severity over the past 3-4 days.  He complains of some weakness in his left leg but otherwise has had no other focal motor or sensory deficits. He has had no recent fevers, chills, SOB, sudden motor or sensory loss.   No new incontinence.

This history was limited by patient   s inability to cooperate.

ED COURSE:  Tox screen and metabolic workup in ED were both negative. CXR and U/A performed showing no infectious processes.  Head CT was performed showing no change from prior, though there was a small increase in the size of the lateral ventricles possibly suggestive of normal pressure hydrocephalus.  LP was negative.  Pt was admitted to Internal Medicine for further workup of recent change in mental status and neuro/psych consult.

Bundle branch block: EKG 7/82 NSR with first degree a-v block and LBBB with LAD. EKG 10/83 normal sinus rhythm with first-degree AV block and occasional blocked APC. There is a nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay with a borderline superior axis. There are nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.
Renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine 1.6-2.2

WBC 7.1, HCT 39.9, Plt 192, RDW 14.4, MCV 89
U/A negative

RADIOLOGY
MRI Brain (7/02/84)
No acute infarction.
Chronic right basal ganglia and bilateral cerebellar infarctions, stable from prior.
Mild progression of periventricular and deep white matter T2  hyperintensity which is nonspecific, likely relating to progression of small vessel ischemic disease.
Interval enlargement of ventricles and sulci consistent with progression of cortical volume loss.

CXR (7/02/84):  WNL

CT Brain (7/02/84)
No evidence of an acute intracranial process.
Mildly increased prominence of the lateral ventricles with increased periventricular hypoattenuation.  Although this likely represents microangiopathic changes with commensurate ventricular prominence, consider normal pressure hydrocephalus in the correct clinical setting.

EKG:  Sinus rhythm, 1st degree AV block with atrial bigemeny. Left axis deviation and LVH by R in aVL >11.

ASSESSMENT & PLAN
87yo M with h/o Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathic (carotid stenosis s/p CEA, PVD) who presents with two weeks of increasing lethargy, disorientation, gait instability and visual hallucinations.  The etiology of this downturn remains unclear.  Given his normal temperature, normal CXR and normal U/A, an infectious etiology is unlikely.  Concern for a stroke-related etiology, either embolic or lacunar, is unlikely given CT and MRI results.  However, microembolic disease may be a possibility.  Given the relatively rapid onset of symptoms, worsening Alzheimer   s dementia is less likely, though often onset of Alzheimer   s may appear to have a rapid onset simply because a threshold of recognition by family members has been reached while the process itself was in fact more protracted.  As suggested in the CT results, normal pressure hydrocephalus may be a possibility, though the lack of incontinence makes this less likely. LP performed in the ED was diagnostic and not therapeutic for NPH.  One further diagnosis to consider would be an encephalopathic process, perhaps due to hypertension.

A more psychiatric etiology should also be considered in this patient.  Depression can often manifest itself with lethargy and disorientation, especially in the elderly. However, it is difficult to adequately assess this in the absence of a caretaker, as Mr Umstead is currently difficult to direct with questioning.

Dementia:  CXR, U/A negative. CT/MRI negative for acute embolic events.  Most likely etiologies are worsening vascular vs Alzheimer   s dementia.
will d/w attending
consider psychiatric consult
Continue Namenda for presumed Alzheimer   s
Will consult neuro for management of Alzheimer   s and further workup of possible NPH

H/o cerebellar stroke: Currently on Aggrenox (not on Coumadin due to fall risk), will continue.

NIDDM: Will start RISS

Hyperlipidemia: Continue Lipitor 20mg PO QD

HTN: metoprolol

Prophylaxis: already on Aggrenox for embolic ppx.

Code Status: Will need to discuss with wife tomorrow.

___________________________________________



Impression: 75 yo F with HTN, DM2, RCC s/p right radical nephrectomy 2079 presents with hypertensive urgency.  Not taking all of prescribed meds.  Could have left sided renal artery stenosis exacerbating HTN in setting of unilateral kidney, K is elevated, although Cr normal on cozaar.  Needs tight BP control esp in setting of DM to prevent nephrosclerosis.





Plan: 

HTN - BP now better controlled, cont to cycle q1 hr for now.  Will repeat EKG, ROMI with serial cardiac enzymes.  ASA, monitor.  Cont cozaar 50 mg qd (may need to d/c or decrease dose if K remains elevated) and start lopressor 25 TID and titrate up as needed for BP control.  Will not attempt to lower BP beyond 150-160's for now to prevent drop in cerebral perfusion pressure.  Cont ativan 0.5-1 mg PO BID PRN.  Consider MRI/MRA to assess for RAS given such severe BP elevation.  Strict I/O's.

F/E/N - Kayexalate 30g x 1, recheck K in AM, consider lasix.

DM - Cont glyburide, check QID FS with insulin SS.  Diabetic diet

Proph - Nexium, SC heparin

2/22/51 cath revealing LM normal, LAD 40% stenosis after D1, 95% stenosis at ostium of D1 and LCX 80% at the takeoff of OM2 with 70%ostial OM2 lesion, and RCA non-dominant with no significant disease.

Because pt was not having any symptoms of angina, the decision was made not to intervene on the LCX lesion and to stress the pt at a later date.

Currently pt is to begin treatment of his pancreatic cancer with chemotherapy and radiation.  Today pt was to have his first treatment, but starting having chest pain and was sent to the ER for further evaluation. 

Recently for the past three days, pt reports on and off chest pain lasting 4-5 hours with raidation to jaw and left arm at rest and excertion. No assciated symptoms of SOB or diaphoresis. Pt thought he was having heartburn symptoms.

In the ER, EKG showed mild lateral ST depression in V5-V6, initial troponin neg and chest pain relieved with one SL nitrogylcerin. Heparin started and pt transferred pain free to Cardiology.   Upon arrival, pt had one episode of chest pain, EKG showed no acute changes, chest pain relieved with one SL nitrogylcerin.

EDVISIT^10776605^Glenn, Olivia^01/14/80^WOODRUFF, FERNE

I saw this patient in conjunction with Dr. Leyva and Dr.

Forrest.  I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the

patient, reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's

chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and

disposition with the patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 65-year-old female with difficulty breathing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with known multiple

medical problems presents with difficulty breathing.  At her

rehabilitation facility was noted to be hypoxic and thus was sent

here.  The patient's recent past medical history is remarkable

for a fall with cervical fractures, rib fractures, and subsequent

hemothorax for which she was admitted to the Educare-Pullman ICU over the

end of December through the beginning of January.  The patient's

chest tube was withdrawn approximately 10 days ago and the

patient has been doing well at rehab since.  However, today was

noted to have desaturations to 80% on room air.  She had

shortness of breath as well.  Her oxygen saturations improved

marginally on oxygenation and have been responsive to

nonrebreather treatment in the transport here.  The patient was

treated with nebulizers and Lasix without significant improvement

and is noted to be quite tachypneic.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, CHF,

diabetes, asthma, chronic renal insufficiency, osteoporosis,

anemia, and cervical fracture.

SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Limited

by the severity of the patient's presentation.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Zocor, PhosLo, calcium carbonate,

Protonix, Niferex, Norvasc, Fosamax, Epogen, Lasix, lisinopril,

Colace, and Xalatan.

ALLERGIES:  Morphine and aspirin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, in some

degree of respiratory distress, however, able to interact and

answer questions in 1-2 word sentences.  Vital signs are as

documented with an elevated blood pressure of 176/96, pulse 76,

and oxygen saturation is 98% on nonrebreather.  HEENT exam is

atraumatic, normal to inspection.  The patient has a large tongue

and her uvula is not visible at all.  Neck is immobilized in a

C-collar and is obese.  Respiratory exam reveals decreased breath

sounds diffusely with tachypnea and respiratory muscle accessory

use.  Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm without

murmur.  Pulses are palpable in all four extremities.  Abdomen is

soft and nontender, obese, but without any organomegaly or

masses, or guarding, or rebound.  Skin is intact, warm, and dry

without any lesions or rash.  Musculoskeletal exam reveals

tenderness over the right ribs where the patient has known rib

fractures.  Neurologically, she is oriented with difficulty

speaking due to respiratory distress but no focal neurologic

deficit.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  BNP is elevated in the 500-600 range.  White

blood count is slightly elevated at 10, hematocrit 26.3, which is

at the patient's baseline, and creatinine of 2.2.  LFTs within

normal limit.  INR 1.2.  D-dimer significantly elevated.  EKG

demonstrates sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave changes.

IMAGING STUDIES:  Chest x-ray shows bilateral effusions, which

are present previously but possibly slightly increased.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was initially given

Lasix and nitro with improvement in her blood pressure and was

also started on CPAP.  She seemed to be improving clinically for

some period of time but then began to decline in her mental

status.  At that time an ABG was sent demonstrating hypoxia. 

Prior to those results, the decision was made that the patient

likely needed intubation.  We had hope to hold off to do a

thoracentesis; however, the patient's clinical course declines

such that it was not possible for her to sit up for the

procedure.  On CPAP, the patient's oxygen saturations were stable

throughout in the 90s, but she developed increasing respiratory

distress.  Intubation was complicated by her inability to flex

her neck, her large tongue, and her body habitus; was successful

in two attempts with one episode of bag mask ventilation in

between those attempts.  For full details of the procedure,

please see the attached procedure note.  Thoracic Surgery was

consulted.  They arrived as the patient was being intubated.  At

this time their recommendation is for a CT scan of the chest to

determine whether this is more likely a hemothorax or a pleural

effusion and whether it is loculated.  This study will be

performed and then patient will be admitted to her ready bed in

the ICU.  A bedside ultrasound was also performed by myself and

the resident demonstrating no obvious pericardial effusion.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral pleural effusions.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory distress.

TERTIARY DIAGNOSIS:  Question recurrent hemothorax versus pleural

effusion.

FOURTH DIAGNOSIS:  Question CHF.

DISPOSITION:  Admitted to the ICU.

CRITICAL CARE TIME:  75 minutes.

RE:  Bird, Terri                                                    
MRN: 80910690                                                           
  
Dear Dr. Irvine:
 
I had the chance today to see Terri Bird in follow-up, as her 
primary care physician. As you are well aware, she is 71-year-old female 
who resides currently at the Elm Hills Nursing Home where you 
have been taking care of her. I have not seen her now for the past ten 
months. For my records, I am going to summarize her medical history 
briefly. It includes a history of atrial fibrillation. She is status 
post an MVR with Duluth Clinic. She is on chronic anti-coagulation. She is 
status post a renal allograft for what is believed to be a history of 
strep glomerular nephritis. She has been on Imuran and Prednisone for 
several decades with no history of rejection. She also has a history of 
a CABG in the setting of her valve replacement. As well, she has a 
history of spinal stenosis, for which she has been treated 
intermittently with epidural steroid injection. About a year ago, she 
had an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and in this setting developed 
some delirium and at that point was sent to rehab where she had a ankle 
fracture and a long recovery and she spent time at several different 
nursing homes and had a hip fracture as well as a recurrent ankle 
fracture and most recently has been with you at Elm Hills Nursing Home. I also have a discharge summary from a recent hospitalization 
where she had a pneumonia, a right middle lobe which was successfully 
treated with levofloxacin. 
 
MEDICATIONS: Her current medications from the notes that I received 
include Premarin .3mg, Neurontin 300mg each day, Miacalcin nasal spray, 
Provera 2.5mg, Synthroid 25mcg, Digoxin 125mcg, Cardizem CD 180mg a day, 
Imuran 100mg a day, Lopressor 50mg twice a day, calcium carbonate 500mg 
three times a day, Isordil 3 times a day as well as Coumadin based on 
her INR.
 
ALLERGIES: She has an allergy to penicillin as well as sulfur and 
cephalosporins and of note she had been on a tapering Prednisone dose 
which seems to have been stopped. As well, she is on sliding scale 
insulin and Humulin N, which seems to have been adjusted recently. 
RE:  Bird, Terri                                                    
MRN: 80910690

The patient was brought to me today by her family, because they were 
concerned that she was not getting optimal care. In talking to her, she 
says she feels quite well. She has no pain. She has no pain in her 
buttocks or her legs. She says her breathing feels well. She has no 
productive cough. She has no chest pain. She denies any peripheral 
edema. She notes that she is concerned that she is not getting enough 
exercise at Elm Hill Nursing Home, but otherwise feels like she 
is getting reasonable care. However, she does breakdown and cry about 
her current situation in that she is depressed about living in a nursing 
home. 
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On the exam today, her blood pressure is 122/70. 
She has a regular rate and rhythm on heart exam with a pulse of 72. She 
has sharp clicks over her chest. She has a soft abdomen with no 
organomegaly and a well healed scar. She has equal pulses bilaterally. 
She has got a normal skin exam with multiple skin tags. She has a full 
range of motion in her upper extremities as well as her hips, knees and 
ankles. She has a stooped gate and I watch her walk with her walker and 
she seems relatively stable. She is somewhat confused about the date and 
the place, but recognizes me and is able to articulate very clearly 
about her current situation at Elm Hills. 
 
I have no laboratory data to speak of. 
 
I had a long conversation with her and her husband as well as her son 
and daughter-in-law and explained my concerns with her overall safety 
and I thought that currently it would be unwise for her to be in an 
unsupervised setting. I thought that a nursing home is a reasonable 
place for her to be and suggested quite strongly to consider an 
antidepressant. It looks like you have had a psychiatrist evaluate her 
recently and I think it would be worthwhile, at least a month trial of 
SSRI, gradually titrating up the dose based on her side effects. 
 
I am more than happy to see her intermittently to give her reassurance, 
but it seems like your care has been excellent and feel free to contact 
me with questions about her past history. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
 
Steve George, M.D.

Mediquik Team 3 Medical Student Admission Note



Pt:  Vollmer, Ulyses	

MR#: 	8740465

Date of Admission: 03/17/84

Attending Oncologist: Dr. Xavier Otero

PCP:  Dr. Geno Guidry

Code Status: Full Code



ID/CC:  73-year-old man with stage IV-B metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presents complaining of three days of constant dizziness.



Source:  Patient, who is a good historian.  Past medical records.



History of Present Illness  



Mr. Vollmer is a pleasant 73-year-old man with a past medical history significant for metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma s/p XRT and chemotherapy, CAD s/p LAD stent placement, and borderline DM who presents to the Health Care Center complaining of 48-hour history of dizziness and subjective fevers.  He was in his usual state of health until three days prior to admission, when he awoke in the morning with a severe headache.  As he got out of bed, he felt extremely lightheaded.  He describes the dizziness as internal, and    not like the room was spinning.     He laid down, with some resolution of the symptoms.  Of note, he reports that the dizziness is less severe when he lies down and comes on with standing or sitting up.  Throughout the day, he developed a cough productive of green sputum, a subjective fever, continued headache, and nausea without vomiting.  He denied any chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or pain upon deep breathing.  That evening, two nights prior to admission, he developed night sweats but had no rigors.  He continued to feel similarly throughout the day prior to admission, and presented to the emergency room for further evaluation.  



The current presentation is in the context of increasingly poor PO intake secondary to chemotherapy and treatment for esophageal cancer.  He reports a four-to-five month history of poor appetite, eating chicken soup.  He denies any trouble swallowing solids or liquids.  Of note, the day prior to the onset of symptoms, he was NPO for a restaging CT scan.  He reports eating two scrambled eggs after the scan, and a chicken potpie for dinner the night prior to symptoms starting.



In the emergency room, vitals were temperature of 95.6, pulse 52, blood pressure 132/68, RR=20, 95% on room air.   He received Zofran 4 mg IV once, levofloxacin 500 mg PO once, and a NS 500 cc bolus.  CXR showed bibasilar infiltrate and bilateral pleural effusions.



Oncology History (per attending notes)

Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.  On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.  The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.  Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma. Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement. Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.  On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.  This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.  The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.  There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung. PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer. The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate. 3/14/84 Restaging work-up revealed progressive disease (see imaging below).



His last Taxotere treatment was February 17; further treatment was stopped secondary to a chemotherapy burn on the right arm.



Past Medical History:  



1.	Metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma:  Stage IV-B s/p Taxotere therapy.

_____________________________________________________________________________________



I/P: 



73-year-old man with metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presents with bibasilar pneumonia and small bilateral pleural effusions.



1.	Pneumonia:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness, subjective fevers, and productive cough of green sputum. Physical exam reveals decreased bibasilar breath sounds, right greater than left.  The constellation of symptoms can be attributed to the pneumonia found on chest imaging.  The possible causes of the pneumonia include aspiration, infectious, and post-obstructive causes. The patient reports no problems with swallowing and has not vomited, making aspiration pneumonia lower on the differential.   The chest CT does not show any evidence of tumor obstruction around the bronchi.  Further, the pneumonia and pleural effusions are bilateral, meaning that the obstruction would have to be higher in the bronchial tree, making obstruction less likely.  In this case the most likely cause is infectious in nature; the agents most likely to cause pneumonia in this patient are the typical bacteria, such as pneumococcus, H. influenza, Staphalococcus, and other gram-negative bugs, atypical bacteria such as Legionella sp, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, and viral causes.  Based upon imaging findings, pneumonia most consistent with a bacterial infectious agent.

a.	Start Levofloxacin 750 mg daily for antibacterial coverage.

b.	Sputum gram stain and culture

c.	Blood cultures

d.	Pneumococcus antigen screening

e.	U/A, urine Legionella

f.	  NS at 75 cc/hour.  If PO intake is not increased, will switch fluids to D5  NS.

g.	Tylenol for fever, Zofran for nausea.

h.	Incentive spirometry every two hours while awake.

2.	Dizziness:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness.  Potential causes include orthostatic causes secondary to hypotension, dehydration, or poor sympthathetic tone; anxiety; cardiac causes (dysrhythmias, CAD), anemia, and electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hypoglycemia).  This patient has a history of CAD, but EKG findings and cardiac enzymes do not suggest cardiac insult.  The patient has not had an increase in the BUN or creatinine from baseline, making dehydration less likely.  Labs did not show any electrolyte abnormalities; therefore hypoglycemia is low on the differential diagnosis.  The dizziness was positional in nature.  The patient reports long-standing poor PO intake, particularly because he was NPO for much of the day prior to the start of symptoms. In this patient, the cause of the dizziness is most likely orthostatic in nature, secondary to poor PO intake and decreased sympathetic tone.  

a.	  NS at 75 cc/hour.  If PO intake is not increased, will switch fluids to D5  NS.

b.	Check orthostatics daily.

3.	Metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma:  Patient presents with known Stage IV-B metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma with new CT findings suggestive of disease progression, particularly in the retroperitoneum.  Has been on Taxotere for the last six months.

a.	Patient does not know of new findings, to discuss with Dr. Otero in AM.

b.	Consider alternative therapies.

4.	Anemia: Patient presents with microcytic anemia (MCV=73).  Not known to be iron-deficient.

a.	Iron studies (Iron, Ferritin, TIBC) to assess iron deficiency versus anemia of chronic disease.

b.	Guaiac stool for evidence of occult blood.

5.	HTN:  

a.	Check orthostatics daily.

b.	Patient is stable on current regimen.  No changes to medications.

6.	CAD/hypercholesterolemia:

a.	Continue with Lipitor 10 mg daily

b.	Cardiac enzymes negative times one.  Per Oncology fellow, no need to cycle given stability of TW changes in EKG and lack of anginal symptoms

c.	Low fat diet

7.	Renal vein thrombosis: 

a.	Stable on Coumadin.

b.	Clarify goal INR level.  Currently INR=3.4.

8.	Prophylaxis:

a.	Nexium for GI prophylaxis

b.	Colace/Mylanta for constipation.

c.	Low-fat, no added salt, no concentrated sugar diet.

d.	Finger sticks after each meal.

Team 3 Intern Addendum:

The patient was seen and examined.  Agree with above excellent HCC3 note.  Briefly, the patient is a 73 year-old male with h/o esophageal CA (Stage 4B), DM, HTN, CAD s/p LAD stent, renal v. thrombosis on Coumadin.  He presents today with 2 days of malaise, nausea, and    dizziness,     which he states does not consist of ""room spinning"" but that he does feel off-balance and is associated with nausea.  His PO intake has been decreased due to nausea.  Has has had a cough productive of green sputum, and CXR evidence of bibasilar consolidations and decreased breath sounds on exam R > L.  He was admitted to medicine for treatment of PNA in the setting of multiple comorbidities, and for lightheadedness on standing which is likely orthostatic.  



Will treat with Levofloxacin 750 PO QD to cover CAP.  Send legionella urinary Agn, and sputum cx (blood cx sent in ED).  Check orthostatics.  IVF gentle hydration.  Need to clarify goal INR in setting of Coumadin use for renal vein thrombosis.  Microcytic anemia-will check anemia labs; already on iron supplementation.  EKG and 1 set of cardiac enzymes do not suggest an acute cardiac event.  Will treat nausea symptomatically.  Discussed with onc fellow (Dr. Kramer).

Has had no exertional chest pains.  Urinates two to three times a
night but not very frequently during the day.  Ran out of her
Lopressor yesterday.  Continues to have some discomfort in her
right buttock radiating down the side of her leg.  Not happy with
the orthotics that were given her for her arch pain because she can
only use them with bulkier shoes.  Has had some right shoulder
discomfort.  
 
Meds:  Procardia XL 120 mg. q.d.  Aspirin 325 mg. q.d.  Lopressor
100 mg. b.i.d.  Micronase 5 mg. q.d.  
 
W. 141.  176/90 in the left arm, 178/90 in the right.  80.  Good
range of motion of the right shoulder.  There is some crepitance
over the AC joint.  No subdeltoid or bicipital tendon tenderness. 
Full range of motion.  Lungs are clear.  Soft, positive S4.  No
pedal edema.
 
1.  CAD.  Doing well without angina.
 
2.  Hypertension.  I renewed her Lopressor. Will recheck this after
she has been taking both medications faithfully.
 
3.  Diabetes.  Will check a glucose today and I renewed her
Micronase.
 
4.  Question right sciatica.  She is not interested in any invasive
therapy so we will not pursue imaging at this time.  She had a
negative CT in 2073.  I put her on 400 mg. of Motrin three times a
day.
 
5.  Arch pain.  This is clearly not that bothersome that she feels
that it is more important to wear lighter shoes.  
 
6.  Right shoulder pain. She may have some mild rotator cuff
tendinitis. We discussed the importance of not overusing this
shoulder and avoiding lifting anything heavier than a coffee cup. 
Motrin 400 mg. t.i.d. on a full stomach.  I showed her some range
of motion exercises.

BMH Cancer Center

Hematology Note



Fellow: James Tyler

Attending:  Cole Morgan



Date of consultation:  October 04, 2061



Diagnosis:  thrombocytosis, reactive vs. essential thrombocytosis



HPI:

27 yo African American male with recent complicated hospital stay at BMH presents to hematology clinic for first time for follow up of his thrombocytosis.



This 27 yo male with history of type I DM who does not get regular medical care in late August was  visiting family in Maryland and had sudden witnessed seizure activity.  At the time, blood sugar was >500.  Upon initial arrival to the ER in Maryland, he has BP 248/146; plt count was in 800's.  The patient was intubated, treated for HTN with labetolol and placed on IV insulin and dilantin  and transferred to BMH for further care.  



At BMH, MRI showed several small areas of infarct read as concerning for embolic CVA- echo was done showing no vegetations, no PFO, NL EF with LVH; TEE without vegetations as well.  LP was done and sent for HSV which was negative.  He underent a renal workup which showed  nephrotic range proteinuria; labs also showed rhabdoymyolysis.   Renal doppler US showed no sign of RAS.  He was continued on abx for his  aspiration PNA.  Other parts of the secondary htn workup were done including evaluation for hyper aldo, pheo.



The vent was weaned and he was extubated on the 4th.  HTN was controlled with labetolol drip with additional oral agents being added.  He continued to have intermittent fevers and was on broad antibiotics which were originally weaned off.



Hematologically, the hct and wbc fell as he was hydrated.   Plt count stayed stable in the 600's for several days before increasing on the 3rd gradually up to the 1000's.   Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were c/w ACD and he was started on epogen.  Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive; CRP was >150 with ESR >100.  He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable.  But his platelets kept climbing to nearly 1.5 million.  A bone marrow biopsy was done showing no cytogenetics to suggest CML and there were elevated megakaryocytes read as concerning for a myeloproliferative process.  As well, he suffered a DVT in his subclavian/IJ on the same side as a central venous catheter.  Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count, he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital.  As well, hydrea was started at this time, initially at 500mg bid and then escalated to 1000mg bid when his counts were up to 800-900 despite the medication.  As well, he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer.  For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA.



He was discharged from the hospital two weeks ago and has done fairly well since then.  His energy has been good.  He denies any fevers/chills/sweats.  No bleeding/bruising.  No further swelling in his arms/legs.  He does have some occasionally blurryness in eyes immediately after taking his anti-hypertensives but no numnbess/weakness/dizziness.

Assessment and Plan:



Interesting case of a 27 yo male with insulin dependent diabetes and apparent untreated HTN who presented with seizure in setting of hypertensive emergency and is found with nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, several small embolic-appearing strokes and has developed marked thrombocytopenia to 1.5 million and had subsequent provoked DVT.  He was treated for concern of essential thrombocytosis in hospital with platelet pheresis then hydrea.  Today, he presents looking well and still has a thrombocytosis despite the hydrea.  It is still not possible to tell for sure if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs Essential thrombocytosis.



At the moment, we will continue to treat this as ET and will continue hydrea at the current dose and ask him to take aspirin 81 mg qd.  If this is a reactive process, time should be a good diagnostic test at this should improve after he is further from his complicated hospital/icu stay.



At his next visit with us next month we will recheck his C-reactive protein, ESR, iron studies/ferritin for some idea of whether his body could still be mounting an inflammatory response to drive a reactive thrombocytosis.  If his plt count comes down, we will be able to start tapering his hydrea at that time.



Of note, in the near future, we may be able to help determine between reactive and essential process with measurement of the JAK2 kinase level.  



In the meantime, he will be meeting with his new PCP and renal physician next week.

CC/HPI:



Pt is 76 yo F with h/o CAD, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, COPD, many pack-years of smoking, and anxiety who presents with c/o SOB.



Pt was in her usual state of health about 1 week PTA, when she noticed gradually worsening SOB and developing cough productive of scant whitish sputum.  She had no fevers/chills, prior URI symptoms/sick contacts, CP/lightheadedness, N/V/abdominal pain, diaphoresis, increasing leg swelling, or orthopnea/PND symptoms.  She thought she might be developing    bronchitis,    discontinued smoking and called her PCP to ask for antibiotics.  She was told to come to the clinic but her SOB progressively worsened in the few hours PTA, and she called for EMS to go to the ED. 



In ED:  

a. Lasix 40 mg IV x2, NTG paste    initial SOB improvement, small UO;

EKG:	old LBBB, no acute ischemic changes 



CXR: cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions



ADENOSINE MIBI (6/89): The ECG response to pharmacological stress was negative for

 ischemia. Images demonstrated a small posterobasal infarction

 associated with mild to moderate inferior ischemia.  Comparison to

 2084 is difficult due to the difference of technique.  However,

 septal ischemia is no longer present in the current study and

 inferior ischemia is still present.



ECHO (6/89): mild mitral regurgitation; LA dilated; 

- trans-aortic gradient ~13 mm HG/no stenosis; 

- LV imildly dilated, w/segmental LV dysfunction [inferior wall]; EF 68 %;

- trace tricuspid insufficiency

- trace pulmonary insufficiency; RV 34 mmHg/ not dilated







A/P: Pt is a 76 yo F with multiple cardiac risk factors who presents with CHF exacerbation. Ddx of precipitants include new myocardial ischemia, hypertensive crisis, medication non-compliance/misadministration, arrhythmia, or infection.  Even though MI would be the most worrisome to follow through with, a simple trigger such as COPD exacerbation cannot be excluded.  



-	continue HF O2, ASA, cardiac enzymes to r/o MI

-	tight BP control w/ CCB and ACEI as needed; may use TNG/Hydralazine

(will hold BB during the acute exacerbation)

-	Lasix IV prn; strict I/Os [admission wt 180#)

-	Low-sodium diet/consider fluid restriction

-	Repeat CXR/EKG

-	Azithromycin 250mg po/Albuterol/Atrovent nebs

-	ECHO in AM/consider ETT/Cardiology: Dr Garner

RE:BRADY DUVALL

RAH#425 03 15 1

 

Dear Denny:

 

Just a note to tell you that I saw Brady Duvall again today for his 

congestive heart failure.  His clinical course is well known to you.  

He has had a slight increase in peripheral edema.  This has occurred 

despite a medical regimen that includes Lasix 40 mg daily, aldactone 25 

mg daily, Coumadin, atenolol 25 mg daily, amiodarone 200 mg daily, 

insulin, vancomycin that was recently discontinued, Zocor 80 mg daily, 

clonopin, Plavix, and glucophage.  He is also on captopril 6.25 mg po 

t.i.d.

 

From a functional point of view, he seems to be stable although, as 

noted, he has had a slight increase in peripheral edema.  His past 

clinical course is well known to you.  As you know, he had an 

epicardial abscess from electrode placement.  

 

From a clinical point of view, he is otherwise stable.

 

Physical examination today is of note for a weight of 193 pounds, blood 

pressure 120/60, with a resting pulse of 76.  Neck veins are distended, 

with positive hepatojugular reflux.  His carotid volume is diminished.  

His lungs are

generally clear, without rales or rhonchi.  Examination of the heart 

reveals a quiet precordium.  There is a soft S3 gallop, no murmur of 

mitral regurgitation, and no obvious murmur of tricuspid regurgitation.  

Abdomen is of note for a liver at the right costal margin.  There is +2 

peripheral edema.

 

The resting electrocardiogram shows paced rhythm.

 

We will be increasing his Lasix to 80 mg daily and following him 

closely by telephone over the next several days.  I have made no other 

changes in his current medical regimen.

 

Many thanks for letting us participate in his care.

 

With best regards.

 

Sincerely yours,

MANAMANA  MEDICAL  CONSULT  NOTE
PATIENT:  Vaughn, Frank R.
MANAMANA MR#:  6767510
PCP:  Henry Jenkins, M.D. (503 155-7742)
PSYCH:  Brittany Prince, M.D.
CONTACT:  Mother, Haley Vaughn (158 857-4114)
SOURCE:   Patient; M.D. Passoff; Previous Medical Records
PRECAUTIONS:   MRSA; VRE
PRIMARY SERVICE:  Psychiatry Service (Internal Medicine)
CONSULT DATE:   6/19/77
TIME:   2:00 PM
CC:  Suicidal ideation
REASON for CONSULT:  Evaluation for history of medical problems


HPI:  Pt is a 33 y.o. male with HTN, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, recent prolonged hospitalization for Fournier&#8217;s gangrene at MANAMANA, and depression, who was transferred to the MANAMANA Psychiatry by his MEDIQUIK psychiatrist, Dr. Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation.  Dr. Prince had arranged involuntary hospitalization for this pt with campus security and EMS, prior to his arrival for the appointment.  However, per Mr. Vaughn, he arrived to the appointment only with the expectation of discussing his depression and refilling his Celexa, which he has been unable to take for the past 2 weeks, due to an expired prescription.  Dr. Prince documents a discussion in which the pt was tearful and emotional, while describing active suicidal ideation with a plan to overdose on oxycodone.  He reportedly had several episodes this past week, where he had more than a hundred oxycodone pills in his hand, but did not follow through on his plans.  Given concern for imminent danger, a Section 12 was completed, and pt was transferred to the MANAMANA ED.  


The pt does admit to phobias of the hospital, and strong desire to avoid admission.  However, he states that his last suicidal ideation was approximately 2 weeks ago, and that he changed his mind, once he realized his mother&#8217;s soon-to-be ex-husband, who has been threatening her, will be released from prison soon.  Moreover, he states that he has been taking all his medications, checking his insulin at least four times a day for his sliding scale, and changing the dressings on his sacral and scrotal wounds, with intent to improving his health.


The Medical Service was asked to evaluate the pt for active and impending medical issues prior to admission to a Psychiatry Service.

ASSESSMENT
33 y.o. male with HTN, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, recent prolonged hospitalization for Fournier&#8217;s gangrene at MANAMANA, and depression, who was transferred to the MANAMANA Psychiatry by his MEDIQUIK psychiatrist, Dr. Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation, who now denies suicidal ideation, but being evaluated by the medical service for active medical issues.  Pt does have hypertension, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, and open wounds near his scrotum and sacrum.  All of these medical issues appear to be stable, although their management could be fine-tuned via an outpatient basis.  Hypertension is being managed appropriately with a betablocker (HCTZ caused hyponatremia), but given his history of microalbuminuria, he should also be on an ACE-I or ARB.  His history of hypertriglyceridemia was persistent, even in the setting of insulin for DM2 and improved glycemic control.  He would also benefit from restarting a fibrate, such as Lopid.  His DM2 is quite stable, as pt reports FS of 100 to 200 at home with his current insulin regimen.  The wounds should be evaluated by his Surgical Team through his outpatient appointments.  His last evaluation by General Surgery just 2 days ago showed significant improvement, with recommendations of BID dressing changes as the pt is currently doing.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Continue Toprol XL 100mg PO once daily
2. Continue NPH Insulin 30 units with breakfast and 10 units with dinner.  If pt is NPO, or refusing to eat a meal, please give only one-half the dose
3. Continue his regular insulin sliding scale as outline in the Medication List with QAC and QHS fingerstick checks
4. No concentrated sweets diet
5. Start Lisinopril 10mg PO once daily
6. Start Lopid 600mg PO BID (30 minutes before breakfast and dinner)
7. Consider checking hemoglobin A1c and fasting lipid profile with reflex check of LDL for triglyceridemia
8. Dry sterile dressing changes to his scrotal and sacral wounds TID and PRN if dressing is soaked
9. Will defer antidepressive medication regimen to Psychiatry Service


Case and plan discussed in detail with Medical Consult Attending, Dr. Hector Bennett.

Follow-up visit for this 77-year-old Chilean woman. 
 
She comes today bothered by right-sided shoulder pain. On a
previous visit she had complained of this and I wanted to put her
on Motrin but she wanted to try Tylenol. The pain bothers her
sometimes at night and is throbbing. It bothers her when she
tries to attach her bra behind her back. Other than that she has
been doing fairly well. She has not had any chest pains. She has
not had any symptoms of TIAs. She has a lot of concern about her
chronic renal insufficiency and wants to discuss this. 
 
Medications: Lopressor. Hydochlorothiazide. Procardia XL.
Micronase. Motrin. Aspirin.
 
Allergies: Lisinopril causes hypokelemia.
 
Family History: Non-contributory. 
 
Social History: She has a daughter, Rhodes, who has been very
supportive. No cigarettes or alcohol. 
 
Review of Systems: She refuses general GYN screening. She had a
hemoglobin A1C in March, which was 6.4. She had an ophthalmology
exam in September. 
 
Physical Examination: Worried. Weight 131 lb. Blood pressure
142/60. Pulse is 72. Skin exam unremarkable. HEENT: EOMI. No
scleral icterus. No lymphadenopathy. No thyromegaly. I cannot
hear any carotid bruits. Lungs are clear. No murmurs. No gallops.
Benign abdomen. No hepatomegaly. No splenomegaly. No pedal edema.
Examination of the right shoulder shows that she has tenderness
on abduction beyond 110 but her most marked tenderness is with
her internal rotation and she is unable to do this further than
L5.
 
Procedure: The right subdeltoid bursa was prepped with Betadine.
The skin was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine in a 27 gauge needle.
The subdeltoid bursa itself was entered with a 21 gauge needle
and a mixture of 1cc of 1% Xylocaine and 40mg of Depo-Medrol was
injected. She tolerated the procedure well.

The patient returns for a follow up visit on her diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure.  She is regularly being followed by Dr. Jarvis, Nephrologist at Salvation Army Hospital, was seen there about two months ago and will return there in June.  She is also treated for her chronic anemia with darbopoetin.  The patient recently has noticed that her blood sugars have decreased progressively, and she has had several episodes of near hypoglycemia.  Blood sugars are often 60 or less.  The patient also complains of pain in her right middle finger and right shoulder pain.



Physical examination reveals an elderly female in no acute distress.  Blood pressure is 142/60, weight is 176 pounds, and pulse is 96.  Glucose done in the exam room today was 110.  Chest is clear bilaterally.  Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, positive S1, S2, negative S3, S4, and no murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and positive bowel sounds.  Lower extremities: No edema and nontender.  Right hand tenderness in the first metacarpophalangeal joint and the overlying tendon and also tenderness diffusely in the right shoulder pain with grossly normal range of motion.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Diabetes mellitus.  The patient's blood sugars have been dropping.  The patient has decreased her glipizide already from 20 mg daily to 10 mg daily.  I will further decrease it to 5 mg daily.  Check hemoglobin A1c today as well as ALT, AST, and creatinine.

2.  Chronic renal failure.  The patient's creatinine clearance is about 15-17, and the patient is approaching end-stage renal failure.  She is being followed by the Renal Department at Salvation Army Hospital, and dialysis is being considered for the midterm management of the patient.

3.  Tendonitis, right middle finger.  After the patient's informed consent was obtained, the area was prepared in the usual sterile fashion, and 1% lidocaine along with 0.2 cc of Depo-Medrol was injected in the area of the flexor POLLICIS longus tendon sheath.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

4.  Anemia.  This is obviously due to the patient's chronic renal disease.  She has been receiving darbepoetin injections, initially weekly, then every other week, and now every three weeks.  We will check CBC today.

5.  Right shoulder pain.  The patient cannot take nonsteroidals due to her renal problem, so I have given her a prescription for Tylenol with Codeine, of which she may take one or one-half tablet as needed to control the pain.

6.  Regular healthcare maintenance.  The patient will follow up with me in about two months.

Reason for Visit:  moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Stage IVB 





Diagnosis/Treatment Summary: 

Stage IVB (axillary and retroperitoneal LN and very large celiac axis LN mass) 



History:  Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia about 4 weeks ago.  On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.  The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.  Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma. Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement. Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.  On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.  This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.  The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.  There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung. PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer. The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate. 



He remains quite asymptomatic with no weight loss and minimal symptoms when he chews his food well.



 

Problems/PMH:

Repair of Zenker's diverticulum in 2080

Aterial stent was placed in the mid LAD in 4/80

Hypercholesteremia

Arthritis

Borderline Diabetic

Heart murmur for 50 years



FH/SH:

Data (laboratory and radiographs)

Assessment and Plan:



72 year old man with Stage IVB metastatic esophageal cancer. He is doing quite well. Given the fairly asymptomatic nature of his cancer we have opted to start with radiation first, as his primary mass is fungating in nature and there has been evidence of blood loss. After radiation is completed in 3-4 weeks, I will see him for consideration of chemotherapy but only after re-staging. If he remains asymptomatic and there has been little progression of disease, we may opt to observe him closely without treatment. If the scans show significant progression or he becomes symptomatic, then we will start systemic treatment soon afterwards. He is not a surgical candidate given his stage of disease and lack of symptoms.



RTC in 5 weeks to assess symptoms and to arrange restaging scans.

Major Problems

Diabetes mellitus

Blood sugars have been good at home.  Hemoglobin A1c's have been good.  We are rechecking that again.

Hypertension

Blood pressure is okay today, 140/68.  We will need to follow this closely.  Her potassium has been up a little bit.  We will need to change around her medications to see if the Norvasc that we put her on increased her potassium.

Health maintenance

She continues to decline sigmoidoscopy and mammogram.  The patient's cyst at the left leg has been removed and is well healed at this time.



Physical examination

Blood pressure 140/68  

Weight   166 pounds

Neck   Thyroid exam is unremarkable

Nodes   No lymphadenopathy

Chest   Lungs are clear with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi

Cor   No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Carotids with normal upstroke without bruits

Extrem   Clear



Disposition

Return is to see me later in the spring.  Diabetes care is up-to-date.  She has her eyes checked and feet followed closely.  We will later discuss with her any further followup about the diabetes with Nutrition.

ED Attending Physician Note

HPI

See NP note for full details. Briefly, this patient has history of back pain, L buttock and leg pain for which he has been scheduled for an outpt open MRI next week. The pain was worse in the last few days such that he has had difficulty walking due to pain. He does not have any weakness or numbness no loss of control of bowel or bladder. No fevers/chills. Has hx of prostate CA which certainly puts him at risk for spine mets.

ROS

See Nursing Notes

PE

See NP note for full exam.

Neurologic exam: A & O x3, CN 2-12 intact, motor 5/5 all ext, sensation intact to light touch throughout, nl gait, normal finger-to-nose bilaterally, neg pronator drift. Pt reports that after having received pain medication he is now able to walk, whereas he wasn't earlier this evening when he first arrived because he was in too much pain.

Medical Decision Making ED Course

75M w/acute on chronic low back and left buttock pain, now improved after pain medication in the ED. The patient has no neurologic deficits at this time and is able to walk without assistance. Given the patient's history of prostate CA, he certainly needs further radiographic evaluation of his spine to evaluate for mets and should undergo MRI to assess for disc disease as well. Pt was offered MRI today, however he is certain he cannot tolerate a traditional closed MRI (he has tried before with medications). Given that the patient does not have any neurologic deficits, it is safe for him to be discharged home on an improved pain regimen with stool softeners as well and f/u with his already scheduled outpt open MRI next week. Pt and family understand to return if pt develops any neurologic symptoms.

I saw this patient with Dr. Queen Pickett.  I confirm that I have

interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's

documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient. 

Please see the resident's note for further details.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Syncopal event.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old male

with a history of atrial fibrillation for which he is on

Coumadin, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease,

hypertension, and prior transient ischemic attack, who had a

syncopal episode yesterday.  As per report, the patient felt

lightheaded and passed out while he was shaving.  The patient

passed out while using in the bathroom.  The patient was actually

caught by son before he actually hit the floor.  The patient did

not strike his head.  There was no loss of consciousness.  The

patient then awoke once he was supine.  The patient later felt

normal.  The patient states that he did have some antecedent

diaphoresis and shortness of breath and possible chest

palpitations.  The patient states that he felt like something was

jumping inside his body.  The patient does complain of some

fatigue and malaise.  The patient denies having any lower

extremity swelling or pain.  The patient denies having any chest

pain at this time.  The patient did have an adenosine MIBI in

March 2095, which showed some areas of reversible ischemia over

the distribution of the left circumflex artery.  The patient's

transthoracic echocardiogram from March 2095 did show some LVH as

well as for an ejection fraction of 50% with some global

hypokinesis.  The patient was seen by his primary care physician,

specifically, Dr. Ross.  The patient was instructed to come to

the Emergency Department for further evaluation and admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vital signs revealed the

following:  The patient's temperature was 99 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Heart rate 63 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths per

minute, blood pressure is 151/18, and oxygen saturation was

interpreted as normal.  General:  Mild-to-moderate discomfort

noted, daughter at bedside, pleasant.  HEENT:  The patient's head

is normocephalic and atraumatic, no scalp hematomas.  Mucous

membranes were somewhat dry.  Posterior oropharynx was clear. 

Neck:  Supple, no JVD.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation

bilaterally.  No focal rhonchi, rales, or wheezes. 

Cardiovascular:  Irregularly irregular, distant heart sounds, no

definite murmurs, rubs, or gallops were appreciated.  GI: 

Abdomen:  Soft, no rebound or guarding, no focal tenderness to

palpation, no palpable pulsatile mass appreciated.  Rectal exam

deferred.  GU exam deferred.  Skin:  Warm and dry, no rash or

lesions were noted.  Back:  No costovertebral angle tenderness. 

There was no presacral edema.  Extremities:  Warm and well

perfused, trace lower extremity edema noted, no asymmetrical

lower extremity edema.  There were no palpable cords.  Neuro: 

The patient was alert and oriented x3, motor, strength, and

sensation were all grossly intact.  The patient's cranial nerves

are grossly intact.  I did not ambulate the patient.

INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  The patient is a 70-year-old male

with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart

failure, prior transient ischemic attack, and atrial fibrillation

for which he is on Coumadin, who presents with a syncopal

episode.  The patient was sent in to the Emergency Department for

further evaluation and workup for this syncopal event. 

Differential diagnosis at this time includes a syncopal event

secondary to dehydration versus arrhythmia.  I do not feel that

the patient had a cerebrovascular accident.  The patient will

need to have screening laboratory studies and formal imaging.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Upon arrival to the Emergency

Department, the patient had history and physical exam performed. 

The patient then had a 12-lead EKG performed.  The patient's

12-lead EKG was consistent with atrial fibrillation with some

T-wave flattening noted.  There were no definite acute ischemic

changes appreciated.  The patient had laboratory studies sent. 

The patient's laboratory studies were notable for a creatinine of

1.69.  The patient does have a history of renal insufficiency. 

The patient's cardiac markers were negative.  The patient's BNP

was elevated at 1380.  The patient's complete blood count was

normal.  The patient's coagulation studies were normal patient's

coagulation studies were notable for an INR of 2.2.  The patient

then had a noncontrast head CT scan performed.  The patient's

noncontrast head CT scan results are still pending at this time. 

The patient also had a 2-view chest x-ray ordered.  The patient's

chest x-ray results are also still pending at this time.  Dr.

Ross kindly and promptly saw the patient here in the Emergency

Department.  He was in agreement with admitting the patient to

Internal Medicine at this time.  The patient will be admitted

to a monitor bed.  The patient will need to rule out for possible

acute coronary syndrome or cardiac ischemia.  The patient will

need further monitoring for possible arrhythmia.  The patient was

in agreement with this plan for admission at this time.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:

1.  Syncopal event, possibly secondary to an arrhythmia.

2.  Atrial fibrillation.

3.  Renal insufficiency.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to Internal Medicine

and to a monitor bed.

CONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISPOSITION:  Stable and satisfactory.

677 Mill Street
Shady Cove, NY 43414
 
Re:  Christine Olivier
     MR #652-33-21-5
 
Dear Dr. Arteaga:
 
Mrs. Olivier returns for follow-up.  Since last seen, she reports
return in a non-exertional left shoulder discomfort syndrome,
occasionally associated with mild dyspnea.  Of note, she underwent
a dobutamine MIBI stress test last June for evaluating a similar
syndrome, and at that time she developed her typical chest and left
back pain syndrome in association with no diagnostic EKG changes at
a peak heart rate of 127, peak blood pressure of 160/60.  A
simultaneously obtained SESTA MIBI scan revealed a global left
ventricular fraction of 42%, a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction
involving 2 out of 20 segments of the inferior wall and minimal
peri-infarct ischemia.  In addition, a venous duplex ultrasound
study done to evaluate her severe left greater than right
peripheral edema showed no evidence of DVT.  
 
Currently she remains on a regimen of amlodipine 5 mg poqd,
atenolol 50 mg poqd, simvastatin 10 mg poqd, lisinopril 10 mg poqd,
Nitropatch .4 mg q.12 hours, Neurontin 400 mg potid, furosemide 40
mg poqd (recently increased), Lamactil 150 mg pobid, Trusopt and
Xalantan drops, insulin 10 units of CZI with 72 units NPH qam and
74 units NPH qpm. 
 
Physical exam reveals an overweight woman in no distress.  Blood
pressure, right arm sitting - 110/70, heart rate - 70 and regular,
respirations - 12 and unlabored, weight - 174 pounds which is four
pounds below her weight of six months ago.  The neck is supple with
JVP flat.  Carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.  Chest is
clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2, and
a I/VI holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla. 
No significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign. 
Extremities reveal marked left greater than right pedal edema. 
Peripheral pulses are diminished.  
 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 70, PR interval
of .12, QRS of .06, QT of .36, axis of -25.  There is borderline

Re:  Christine Olivier
     MR #652-33-21-5
 
 
evidence for left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary ST and T-
wave changes.  Compared with the last electrocardiogram, there has
been no significant change. 
 
Presently, Mrs. Olivier has evidence of continuing chest and left
shoulder discomfort which she believes is similar to her pre-bypass
surgery angina.  In this setting, a dobutamine stress test
performed last June showed no evidence of provokable ischemia.  I
have spent some time discussing with Ms. Olivier our various
therapeutic and diagnostic options.  She made it quite clear that
she would not consider repeat cardiac catheterization at this time,
and furthermore, was very disinterested in pursuing the possibility
(should she require it) of either mechanical or surgical re-
vascularization.  It is not entirely clear to me that her left
shoulder syndrome is in fact ischemic in origin, and she certainly
understands it may be secondary to musculoskeletal abnormalities. 
I have suggested that she discuss that further with you.  In the
meantime, I have asked her (as her back and chest discomfort
syndrome appears to occur mostly at night prior to lying down for
bed) to apply her Nitropatch in the evening and take it off in the
morning.  She will call me within the next several days to report
how this helps her discomfort syndrome.  I do not believe that she
is having GERD to explain her symptoms.  In light of her reluctance
to undergo any further diagnostic cardiac studies, I will try to
tailor her anti-ischemic medications to minimize her chest
discomfort syndrome.  I, of course, will keep you fully informed as
to her progress, and I thank you for allowing me to assist in her
care. 
 
Sincerely yours,
 
 
Irineo Tovar, M.D.

Initial Medical Consultation Follow-up



Referred by: Dr. Juan Yun, psychopharmacologist, (PCP is Xavier Hobbs, MC) for comprehensive evaluation of obesity and consideration of treatment options.  Patient is being evaluated concurrently by a nutritionist and a psychologist.



CC/ HPI:  Patient is a 69 year old male, with 

Weight:  213  ( 227  231 )   lbs   Height:    68   Inches   BMI: about  35 -> 32/33

and with obesity-related complications as listed below.  Main concerns about weight include: ""I am overeating and can't stop"".  Pt says he can't stop eating after 3-4 pm, gets enraged, aggressive, anxious, restless, (was given barbiturate and Ativan prn for this, and has improved somewhat ~40%) eats 1/2 gallon of ice cream per day, eats as aggressively as he feels, ongoing for 1.5 yrs.  Afraid he will do something aggressive, and uses entering a ""food-coma"" to help restrain himself.  Has bipolar, is in ""mixed state"" now, with characteristics of both depr and mania.  Has neurendoc MD, thinking his pattern related to ""peak endocrine secretions"".



Had binge drinking episodes till 2 yrs ago.  Drank for 2 days when switching into mania.  Learned to use substitution.  Learned to recognize mania coming on, prodrome, less need for sleep, euphoric speech, spending money.  Wife helped identify this.  Substituted going boating, listening to music, walking, talking to friends.



Wonders if substitution method can work for eating.  A potential method is to use 8 oz water or dietetic candy which have worked to satisfy his hunger.



Learned aggression is PTSD.  Rel to betrayal by mother at age 13.  Trapped, helpless, boxed in.  Medical ailments make him feel the same way.



Has has had talking therapy for ETOH, never for PTSD.



Thinks he may need therapy with wt loss program.



New hx:

Doing well with indiv psych and nutrition (reviewed notes).



When depressed uses food for comfort.



Afternoon ""warewolf"" mode: every day 4-7 pm gets agitated, hostile, aggressive, hunger.  Hypothesized per neuroendocrine that cycles ""out of sync"".  Tried lorazepam, klonzepam.  Eats PB sandwich.  Would like something to reduce appetite during that time.  Has tried lots of water at the time, may work for him.



Recent radiowave ablation for lumbar back pain.  Expect proced to help for 1-3 yrs.  Felt ""like a new man"" afterwards.  Was told it is now OK to exercise, has started exercise at gym.  Treadmill.  In addit to walking dog (not aerobic) 2 miles twice a day.  Now 2 goal is 3 times a week.  Also swims.



[prior]

Started Tramadol, thinks it's helping curb his hunger.  Will have ablation procedure for pain.



WEIGHT HISTORY:

Onset of obesity/overweight:  Birthwt 10'3.  Heavy till 17.       Highest weight:  220->255 (2103 dx'd with CNS lupus and given prednisone)  

Course, triggers and exacerbators of weight gain:  Genetics.  Lost wt in military, wrestled at 177#, this wt till 25yo.  Wt gain onset w/ marriage, pt cooked, both ate.  Lots of sports and activity over the years.  Less time for phys activity as got busier by his early 50s.  Gained 35# on Prednisone x 4 yrs.  Gained 20# over last 1.5 yrs w/ psych-induced eating as above.

  Family weight hx: F was built like pt, M 98# and could ""outeat any man and never gained wt"".

  Eating habits: Bingeing?     Night eating?   Excessive hunger?  No   Feels fullness? Yes   Eat past full?  YES   Full details per dietician note.

  Emotional factors/triggers of eating:  See HPI

  Exercise:  HS football westling, military wrestling, coll wrestling, 7 mi/d run, tennis for 20 yrs w/ wife.  Currently walks dog 4 miles a day, ""not at aerobic speed"".

  Prior medications promoting wt gain (diabetes, hormones, steroids, psychiatric):  Prednisone 4 years

Various psych (Lexapro, Effexor, Depakote, Prozac)- no wt gain attributed.



Attempts at weight loss:  ""Will power and stepping up the exercise"".  Yo-yo'd.  Details per dietician note.

  Weight loss medications:   Phen/Fen lost 20#.

  Dietician:  No.

 

PMH - obesity complications:

Pt continuing comprehensive program of individualized nutritional education addressing meal structuring, portion control, food choices, etc. and psychological counseling addressing emotional contributors to eating and weight gain.  Seeing Paul Edwards RD, and Allison Ng, PhD.  Lost 18# in 4 months (1 pound a week) so far with nutritional change, exercise.  Commended pt on success.



Pt will continue exercise (walks 4 mi/d, gym 2 (going to 3) times a week for an hour, swimming).



Because of the afternoon period he describes as being like a ""Warewolf"" (4-7 pm), I recommended he use this time for exercise rather than for his other, more sedentary, activities.



At a later time we can consider medication (in this case, orlistat).  Currently progress is excellent without needing it.



Discuss elevated BP with PCP, may need higher dose of ACEI.



F/U w/ me 2 - 2.5 mos.



>50% of the 30-minute visit was spent counseling the patient about the potential implications of obesity and obesity-related conditions, and the above treatment plan.  All questions answered.

Amir Naranjo, M.D.
Saint Josephs Hospital Of Atlanta
4 Kelly Street
Bangkok, NJ  53591


Dear Dr. Naranjo:


We saw Anthony Vigil in the Internal Medicine at the Dixmont State Hospital on 03/09/2087.  He underwent orthotopic heart transplant at the Dixmont State Hospital on 03/30/2084 and returns now for his annual evaluation.  In the interval since last seen, he has done reasonably well.  His last annual evaluation at Lorain Community Hospital revealed an ejection fraction of 55% by echocardiography and no coronary disease, although left anterior descending was tortuous.  Filling pressures were normal, then with a wedge of 15 and a right atrial pressure of 9 while the pulmonary artery pressure was 30/19 with a mean of 25.  The patient does have a herniated disk at L4 and stenosis at L5.  He has lower extremity cramps, which potentially due to his spine disease have been markedly exacerbated by Pravachol.  The Pravachol was therefore stopped, restarted, and stopped again.  He continues to take insulin and his last hemoglobin A1c was 6.6.  He has had two recent episodes of mild hypoglycemia.  He has had no dermatologic evaluation.  He denies angina, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias.


Physical Examination:  Reveals a weight of 183 pounds, blood pressure of 121/71, pulse of 100.  Jugular venous pressure is 8 cm of water.  Carotid upstrokes are brisk without bruits.  There are diminished breath sounds in the left lung.  Point of maximum impulse is not displaced.  First heart sound is normal, second crisp and clear.  He has an S4 at the left sternal border.  The abdomen is without hepatosplenomegaly.  There is no peripheral edema.  Peripheral pulses are diminished.


The electrocardiogram reveals a right bundle-branch block pattern with an intrinsic rate of 98 beats per minute.  There are nonspecific T-wave changes particularly in the early precordium.


Current Medications:  Calcium with D 1250 mg twice per day, Cardura 4 mg, CellCept 1000 mg twice per day, diltiazem CD 240 mg twice per day, Ecotrin 81 mg per day, Lantus insulin 26 units at night, magnesium oxide 400 mg twice per day, vitamin, cyclosporine 100 mg twice per day, Neurontin 100 mg twice per day, NovoLog insulin as needed, prednisone 5 mg per day, vitamins C 500 mg twice per day, and vitamin E 400 units twice per day.


Impression:  The patient will undergo his annual evaluation over the next 24 hours.  This will include blood work, chest x-ray, echocardiogram, metabolic exercise stress test, cardiac catheterization, coronary angiography, and endomyocardial biopsy.  We will see him after completion of these studies and review the results with him.  We will transmit the results to you as well at that time.


Sincerely,

Narrative History	

81 year old woman who presents for an annual exam with her daughter-in-law, Franchesca Justice.  They would like to discuss the following issues:

1.  Shoulder pain:  She continues to have bilateral shoulder pain, but the L shoulder is worse than the right.  She has been taking Prednisone 9 mg a day for a long time but has not f/u with Rheum for about a year.  She did have a cortisone in the L shoulder in the past.  She is able to lift her arms over her head.

2.  Depression:  Her family feels that she is doing much better on the Effexor than the Celexa.  The pt has seen Dr. Ramsey in Psych a few months ago.  

3.  Dementia:  Dr. Ramsey recommended continuing on the Aricept.  Overall, the pt's family feels that her memory is worsening, although some days are better than others.  She has not had any other episodes of halluncination, as was described in an email from her son a couple weeks ago.  The pt states that she is sleeping and eating well, but her family thinks that she sleeps too much.

4.  Eyelid surgery:  She is scheduled to have surgery on her eyelids on May 25.  The drooping of the lids is so bad by the end of the day that she is unable to read.

5.  Incontinence:  She has now had 3 collagen implants for her bladder.  The pt does not think that she is any better, but when Dr. Xuereb tested her a few months ago, she saw some improvement.

6.  Diarrhea:  She has about 2 soft BM's a day, but she also has intermittent diarrhea.  Her daughter-in-law is wondering if the pt might be lactose intolerant.  She is not having any blood in her stool.  She does not have any diarrhea in the middle of the night.  She has never gotten a colonoscopy since the last attempt just prior to her hospitalization 2 years ago.

7.  DM:  The pt states that she does not eat much sugar, but her daughter-in-law thinks that she probably does consume a fair number of sweets.

8.  Hyperlipidemia: She has been on Zocor 20 mg QD but is not following a low fat diet.

9.  Medication compliance:  The pt's family is not sure if she is taking her medications every day.  They pay a private nurse to come lay out the meds in the am, but the pt is often asleep when she comes and will not get up to take the meds at that time.

10.  Onychomycosis:  The pt has a fungal infection in her great toes.  Her daughter-in-law is wondering if there is anything topical to treat this with.  The pt gets regular pedicures.

Social History	

Lives in Forest Hills, an assisted living facility; never smoking; Etoh- rare- she might have one drink if she goes to her son's house for dinner; exercise- walking.



Family History	

Family History: mother died at 89 of ""old age""; father died of unknown causes; no breast or colon ca; brother is s/p MI before age 60; + DM.



Review of Systems	

No change in weight, appetite.  No dizziness, F/C/N/V, cough, SOB, CP, abd pain, constipation, dysuria, joint pain.

SKIN:		NL turgor, no abnormal lesions.

HEENT:	            NL eyes, lids drooping over eyes about 1/2 way; NL oropharynx

NECK:	            No thyromegally, no nodes; carotids 2+ bilat without bruits.

NEURO:	            NL MS, NL gait



Assessment and Plan	

1.  PMR:  Discussed the importance of regular f/u with Dr. Inge.  We should aim to get the dose of Prednisone decreased.  Will check ESR today.  Franchesca will make sure appt is scheduled with Dr. Inge.

2.  Depression:  She seems better.  Continue Effexor. 

3.  Dementia:  Will continue Aricept.  Discussed keeping pt stimulated with outings, family visits.  Her excessive sleeping is likely a combination of several factors, including her multiple medications, depression, and possibly the dementia.

4.  Eyelid surgery:  Pre-op exam today.  Will order complete metabolic panel, CBC, and EKG.

5.  Incontinence:  It is not likely that she will be able to have any more procedures at this point.  Some of the incontinence may be secondary to dementia rather than pure stress incontinence.

6.  Diarrhea:  Discussed trying a lactose-free diet for a week to determine if lactose-intolerance may be playing a role.  Will set up a virtual colonoscopy since the pt had such a bad experience with the sedation for her colonoscopy 2 years ago.

7.  DM:  Check glucose and Hgb A1C.

8.  Hyperlipidemia: Check fasting lipids- she will get them drawn at Dameron Hospital.

9.  Medication compliance: Discussed trying to get nurse to come a little later in the day so that pt could be observed while taking her medication.

10.  Onychomycosis:  I do not think oral medication would be a good idea for this patient because the risks of hepatotoxicity outweigh the benefits.  Will refer her to Podiatry for care of the toenails since the pt has a h/o peripheral neuropathy.

11.  Health maint:  Order mammo to be done at DH; TSH.

Mr. Ostrander is here for follow-up of his thyroid situation, however due to 
scheduling difficulties he is only having his thyroid uptake and scan 
currently.  He took the tracer and he had his first scan now and the 
testing wont be done until tomorrow.  Thyroid function tests were 
completely normal.  His chest x-ray is completely normal except for 
tracheal deviation I believe which is due to his goida.  I talked to him 
that if the nodule were cold we will need a fine needle aspirate.  I also 
said to him that he made need to see a thyroid specialist.  Though 
slightly anxious he is agreeable to this.
 
He did not bring with him the pathology final report of his lymph node 
biopsy but he was told it was a reaction to an infection and no further 
follow-up or treatment was necessary.
We then talked about smoking cessation and he and his live-in have picked 
a date namely Jun 8th to quit .I tried to give him as much encouragement 
for that as I could.

DIAGNOSIS:
1. Hypertension.
2. Pedal edema.
3. Diabetes.

HPI: Ruth is a 42 year old woman who presents for follow
up of medical issues as well as for new pedal edema over the
past 2 weeks.  When I saw her a few weeks ago, she was very
dehydrated and required a decrease in dose of her Lasix due
to symptoms of dehydration as well as a rise in her
creatinine and BUN.  She responded well to this and then did
well for a week or so.  Then she saw Dr. Vuong who
increased her dose of Lasix back to 20 mg in the evening. 
Subsequently, she developed pedal edema which, at times, is
up to her knees and has been very bothersome for her.  Of
note, she started Norvasc within the past few months and it
was gradually increased to 10 mg a day.  She reports her
blood sugars have been under excellent control, ranging from
90-120s-140s especially over the past couple of weeks.  She
has had a couple of lows in the 40s over the past couple of
months.  She again has not yet followed up with Dr. Vicki
Klein as I had recommended for help with her diabetes.  She
reports her blood pressure in Dr. Vuong's office was
normal as well.  She denies any orthopnea, PND, increased
shortness of breath or dyspnea on exertion.  No fever or
chills.  Remainder review of systems negative.  She does
report sweating with meals that she is unsure how long she
has had but has noted it over the past few months. 

MEDICATIONS: As noted in the record and confirmed.

ALLERGIES: Lisinopril causes cough.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is a pleasant woman in no acute
distress.  Her skin is very tanned.  Blood pressure 148/62,
on repeat it is 160/70, pulse of 88, weight of 150, weight
is up about 6 pounds for her.  HEENT within normal limits. 
Neck: no JVD.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no
crackles or rhonchi.  Cardiovascular exam: normal S1, S2,
II/VI systolic murmur at right sternal border.  Abdomen is
benign.  Extremities: she has 1-2+ pitting pedal edema to
mid shin.  

IMPRESSION AND PLAN: 42 year old woman with:
1. New pedal edema.  Reviewing patient's recent lab results,
she does have proteinuria but it is actually improved since
the last time it was checked and also her creatinine has
improved.  I believe the pedal edema may be related to the
Norvasc.  Therefore, I advised her to stop the Norvasc and
she will call me tomorrow to let me know how she is doing as
it may take a few days to resolve.  Will consider increasing
her Lasix based on how she responds to discontinuing the
Norvasc and her labs.  Will check basic metabolic panel and
urinalysis as well.
2. Hypertension since discontinuing Norvasc.  Will start
atenolol in a low dose but advised her not to start this for
the next few days.  Will start at 12.5 mg a day and increase
to 25 mg a day and she will follow up in the next few weeks
for a repeat blood pressure check.
3. Diabetes.  The patient is strongly encouraged to make an
appointment with Dr. Vicki Klein regarding the diabetes to
see if there is anything more we can do to change her
insulin regimen.  

The patient to follow up with me by phone tomorrow and
otherwise in the next 3 weeks for a blood pressure check and
sooner if no resolution of her pedal edema.

Long Beach, VT 26289

Dear Dr. Umali:

Just a quick note to let you know that I saw Larry Lockwood in followup today.  Mr. Lockwood has been generally feeling well and has no complaints except ongoing left lower extremity edema in the foot only, which is unchanged times many years.  He has otherwise been feeling relatively well.  He continues to be followed by Dr. Aguilera who prefers to take a conservative approach given the difficulty of performing a bone marrow biopsy and low levels of IgA paraprotein.

Review of systems is negative except as above.  Fingersticks remain well controlled in the range of 80-150s.

Interval family, social, and medical history are unchanged.

Current Medications:  Include lisinopril 20 once a day, Proscar 5 once a day, Flomax, aspirin 325 once a day, atenolol 25 once a day, trazodone, folate, MVI, saw palmetto, glucosamine, selenium, vitamin C and vitamin D, Lipitor 20 mg once a day, and Plavix 75 once a day.

Physical Exam:  Well-developed, obese in no apparent distress.  BP 169/83 and pulse 58.  Neck:  Supple without JVP or lymphadenopathy.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.  Cardiovascular exam:  S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Extremities:  No edema, warm.

Laboratory Data:  Recent BUN and creatinine 18 and 1.5.  Repeat labs will be done when he comes in next week for his routine labs at the SCH.  Skeletal films are pending.

Impression:  Mr. Lockwood chronic kidney disease appears to be stable, as I have mentioned before, he most likely has some underlying diabetic and/or hypertensive nephropathy, but I continue to wonder whether the IgA paraprotein is playing a role in the increasing proteinuria and mild CKD. Chemotherapy would be indicated if that were the case..  He is being followed conservatively by Dr. Aguilera thus far in the absence of defniitive data.  I have ordered skull and hip films today to look for evidence of myeloma-related bone disease, which if present could distinguish  more significant disease from MGUS.  I  agree with Dr. Altman  that in the absence of definitive data,as long as creatinine is improving and urinary protein levels remain stable  the current approach is  reasonable.  However, we should have a low threshold for pushing Mr. Lockwood to having either a renal or more preferably bone marrow biopsy.

In the meantime because he continues to have protein and albumin in his urine, I have initiated dual angiotensin blockade and have added Cozaar 25 mg a day to his regimen.  He will follow up with me in four months and will have labs next week at the SCH.  Thank you for referring this patient.

Sincerely,

	Interval History:

   He has had angioplasty of the circumflex vessel and angioplasty and stenting of a diagonal branch of his LAD, both in May 2071. A relook in February 2072 revealed that the stent was patent.



His sx with original stenting were chest presure and burning



He has now come to ER with brief unprovoked stabs of L high lateral point pain w no associated sx occurring repeatedly over several hours w NO other relevant hx. The pain seemed to improve with local massage







	Family history:

   He has one sister living in St. John's who has diabetes. Both his parents had diabetes as well. They are both deceased



	Social history:

   He is now fully retired from quarrying. He is married and lives with his wife.  



Physical examination:

	

-resp. rate: 16  

-General:   No acute distress.

-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.

-Heent:   Unremarkable

-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP no jugular venous distention.

-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.

-Cardiac:   Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 or S4. There was a 2/6 systolic murmur of MR

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.

	Assessment and plan:

   He has presented with very atypical chest pain with negative markers and unchanged ECG. Thjis is chest wall pain - not cardiac. It is clearly - in pt's view and mine - different from the pain of his CAD. He is OK to go home with dx of chest wall pain. OK to use Ibuprofen prn - should be ok in low dose on full stomach despite his h/o dyspepsia. F/u w Dr Cook.

Xanders, Ruth

MR #564-19-92-7

December 16, 2081

 

Ms. Xanders is a 42-year-old woman with multiple medical problems who

presents for evaluation of chronic hepatitis C.  She reports having

had a blood transfusion in 2059 and has had no history of other

percutaneous exposure including intravenous drug use.  She has had

normal transaminases in the past but a positive hepatitis C

antibody test.  She reports no abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting,

anorexia or weight loss, no diarrhea, constipation, melena or

bright red blood per rectum.  She has had no fevers, chills,

sweats, arthralgias, myalgias or skin rash, epistaxis, easy

bruising or bleeding gums and she has no insomnia or episodes of

confusion.  She reports a generally good energy level with some

mild fatigue.  

 

Past Medical History:

     1.  Hypertension.

     2.  Diabetes.

     3.  Chronic renal insufficiency.

     4.  Hyperlipidemia.

 

Current Medications:  Humulin NPH 20 units qAM, 15 qPM, Humulin

Regular insulin 3 units qAM, 5 qPM, Lipitor 40 mg po q.h.s.,

Procrit 3,000 units sub q. bi week, Lasix 40 mg po q. day, Quinine

260 mg po q.h.s. and Hyzaar 100/25 mg po q. day as well as Naftin

prn.

 

Allergies:  Lisinopril causes cough.

 

Family History:  No history of liver disease or GI malignancies.  

Social History:  She continues to smoke but has cut back recently

and she drinks alcohol approximately once a week to once every two

weeks.  

 

Review of systems otherwise negative for HEENT, cardiovascular,

respiratory, GI, GU, musculoskeletal or neurological systems.

 

On exam, she is a well-appearing woman in no acute distress.  Pulse

80 and regular, blood pressure 152/76, weight 151 pounds.  HEENT

she is anicteric with equal, round, reactive pupils and normal

conjunctivae.  Oropharynx reveals no ulcers or icterus.  Neck

reveals no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Chest is clear to

auscultation and percussion.  Heart reveals a regular rate and

rhythm, S1 and S2 are present without murmur, rub or gallop.  

Xanders, Ruth

MR #564-19-92-7               -2-            December 16, 2081

 

Abdomen is soft, nontender and non-distended with no

hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Extremities reveal no clubbing,

cyanosis or edema.  

 

Most recent labs from October 22, 2081 reveal an ALT of 13, AST 19,

alkaline phosphatase 78, bilirubin 0.3, creatinine 3.1, albumin

3.6.  

 

Impression:  Ms. Xanders has a history of a positive hepatitis C

antibody with normal LFT's.  Today, we will check a hepatitis C RNA

level to see if she is in fact viremic or whether she is one of the

lucky 15% of people who clear the virus but remain antibody

positive.  If she does not have hepatitis C RNA in her blood, than

she requires no further workup.  However, if she is RNA positive

than I would suggest a liver biopsy to assess the degree of

inflammation of fibrosis in her liver and make possible plans for

treatment with interferon/ribavirin.  She is amenable to this and

we will follow-up in two weeks by phone to discuss the results of

her RNA test.

Name: 	 Catherine Kong
MR:	6746781
DOA:  	4/3/89
DOT: 4/4/89
PCP:  William Sawyer
Attending: WARD
CODE: FULL


HPI:  
Please see admit note for details of history prior to admission.

Overnight in the SDU, patient was given several stepwise doses of lasix. She put out about 500cc to 30 IV lasix, then another 300cc to 40 IV lasix. Patient was hypoxic on a NRB with sats in low 90s and RR of 45, but improved when transitioned to high flow O2 with saturation in high 90s and RR of 30.

Bedside TTE done in the morning confirmed aortic valve leaflet vegetations and moderate AI. CT surgery was consulted, and given prior hx of angina and recent episodes of chest pain, they requested cardiac cath prior to OR for valve replacement.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 

70 yo F p/w acute CHF 2/2 aortic insufficiency from subacute aortic valve endocarditis

CV:
Ischemia: History of stable angina, no prior MI. No acute ST changes, borderline troponin elevation, recent history of chest pain at rest.
Cardiac cath today to eval for CAD
Hold anticoagulation given likely CT surgery
Pump: AV endocarditis by TTE resulting in moderate AI and significant pulmonary edema. Per discussion with microbiology lab at Community Hospital, patient was positive for Beta Strep Group B 2/2 bottles on 2/21/89, sensitivities were not done.
Continue amp/vanc/gent, await culture and sensitivity results
Continue to titrate lasix to TBB     1-2 liters per day
Rhythm: Normal sinus rhythm
Continue to monitor for any development of AV block that might indicate aortic valve abscess

NIDDM
Hold metformin, RISS

&#183; EKG: Regular rate, sinus rhythm, indeterminate versus right axis. Frequent PVCs, Anterior Q waves, prolonged QT



ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN: 66 yo m w/ likely new onset CHF.  Given his exam, I would favor systolic heart failure &gt; diastolic heart failure, although he has features going for both.  Features going for systolic are his widely displaced PMI and the fact that he had a mildly dilated LV on an echo in 2092.



I think he most likely has dilated cardiomyopathy 2/2 mitral regurgitation, which was moderate to severe in 2092.  His murmur is quite impressive.  Another possibility is alcoholic cardiomyopathy.  Ischemia is not out of the question given his age and risk factors. He is also a smoker.  



Another possibility is diastolic failure given his hypertension and likely diabetes.



1.        CHF &#8211; Still quite volume overloaded on exam.  Will give another dose of lasix 40 IV tonight.  Start captopril 6.25 q8 to also control BP.  Repeat echo in the am.  Strict I/Os, fluid restriction, low fat, low salt diet.  If EF is depressed, will start beta blocker, consider aldactone.

2.        Substance abuse &#8211; Will obtain Johnson Rehab consult for alcohol and cigarettes.

3.        HTN &#8211; Poorly controlled, captopril

4.        Elevated blood sugar &#8211; Will obtain fasting BSs and right for sliding scale insulin.  Will obtain HgbA1C

5.        Hyperlipidemia &#8211; LDL 128 in 2090.  Will start statin and check fasting lipid panel in am.

6.        Restless leg syndrome &#8211; Likely 2/2 iron deficiency anemia.  Will replete till ferritin &gt; 50 before treating

7.        Iron deficiency anemia &#8211; Will start iron sulfate, recheck ferritin.



F/E/N:  low salt, low fat/cholesterol diet

 Patient says she takes prune juice daily for bowels to avoid constipaiton.



 Patient denied any hx of diverticultis or prior similar problems.

 Asking her about scar on hypogastruim she said was a bladder operation.

   

 Pertinent PMH:

    Is diabetic on glyburide

    Has been on prednisone for PMR, tpaering dose. Current dose per RN sheet is total 8 mg per day prednisone.

    Although mention of prior colonoscopy is made, I could not find record of results to see if known diverticuli

    A more recent colonoscopy attempt failed do to poor clean- out and patient intolerance

    Hx of chronic diarrhea

                       that she is on prednisone which may mask symptoms, as well as diabetic and dementia

                       could also obscure exam as well as history, I am concerned about acute diverticulitis.



                 I am unable to find if known diverticuli in past.

	CARDIOLOGY
	

	BAPTIST MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
	


	Reason for visit:
   coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, history of syncope


	Interval History:
   Mr. Shepherd is a 79 year old man with coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, carotid disease, and peripheral vascular disease who was admitted to the medicine service in June, 2094, for syncope and now returns for cardiology followup.  

To summarize, in June, the patient was admitted after experiencing several syncopal episodes.  They were associated with a prodrome of lightheadedness and weakness that sometimes occurred with positional changes and at other times at rest.  He denied associated chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, vertigo, focal neurologic weakness, dysphagia, diplopia or blurry vision occur during the episodes. These spells lasted about 4-5 minutes and there were no incontinence, post-ictal symptoms, or tonic-clonic movements.   

His workup included a surface echocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 59% but with inferior wall motion abnormalities.  A subsequent adenosine MIBI showed mild inferolateral ischemia and a cardiac catheterization showed 40% ostial RCA disease and a 75% lesion in a small diameter distal PLV.  The culprit lesion was felt to be non-intervenable and the patient was started on medical therapy.  During his admission, his telemetry showed a twelve beat run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and so the electrophysiology service was called.  He underwent an electrophysiology study which was nondiagnostic and a REVEAL monitor was implanted.  Prior to his discharge, the patient exhibited features of depression with psychotic features and he was ultimately transferred to the in-patient psychiatry unit for about four weeks. 

Today, he presents with no acute complaints.  He denies chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations.  He   s had no further fainting spells and reports that his last REVEAL interrogation was unremarkable.  His claudication is at his baseline.  He walks at a mall for 30 minutes to 1 hour before he experiences a ""tired"" sensation in both legs.  He is followed in the vascular clinic at the FHV medical center.  Also of note, he underwent a repair of a right inguinal hernia in October of 2094 by Dr. Small without complications.

Neurology Attending Staff:


July 8, 2122
Time of exam 1:05 PM
Patient: Lloyd Coleman
Reason for admission: headache, gait instability, mental slowness


I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Craft who has been admitted to the Neurology service for evaluation and management.  Along with the Neurology Residents, I personally interviewed, examined, and counseled the patient, confirmed the history and findings, reviewed records and studies, and discussed the impression and recommendations.  For greater details of H/P/ROS/meds/exam/labs/studies, and assessment &amp; plan, please refer to the neurology resident admit note by Dr. Robert Neil (and below under my assessment). 


ROS performed across 10 systems are negative (as noted in neurology note) except as noted in Hx/Assessment and resident's note. 


Cognitive and Elemental neurologic exam as noted in neurology resident note. 
Of note, AFVSS, was asleep but awoke to voice and became alert, attentive to examiner, but had moderate psychomotor retardation. Was slowly conversant and followed simple multiple step commands across midline. 
Oriented to time/date/place. 
Great d/w simple attention (MOY backwards only to Nov, skipped Oct went to September and then went forwards again). 
Able to perform complex attention and working memory bihemispheric Newberry location alpha-numeric task after a second trial. 
Language: fluent w/o dysarthria. Farily Intact naming for high and low frequency items except clasp and had some mild retrieval d/w. 
Memory: gives good details of recent events including hospitalizations. 
Leprosarium name and address: 5/5 registration --&gt; 2/5 recall in 5 min --&gt; 1/3 recognition from a list
Presidential candidates = Xayarath and Golden
Calculations: # of quarters in $6.75 = 27
Moderate d/w Luria fist-side-palm that improved w/ verbal cuing but still poor L&gt;R. 
No EDSS, neglect, R-L confusion or apraxia. 
Mood: ""low ... my daughter has cancer that spread to the bones""; Affect: congruent. 


CN's II-XII intact, good up and down gaze and w/o IV or VI CN palsy. 
No PND, abnl movements, tremor, asterixis, or UE ataxia. Slow but okay FFM, FNF, RAM. 
Full MS, nl DTR's and tone. Plantar responses flexor. 
Mildly diminished stocking distributaion of LT/Cold/VS both legs to mid-shins. HKS mild d/w. 
Unable to stand w/ feet together even w/ eyes open. Moderate retropulsion trying to stand and moderate to severe retropulsion w/o spontaneously recovery on pull-test. Narraw base, small step size w/ low steppage, cautious and w/ retropulsion, slow rate w/ 10 step en bloc turning w/ imbalance (backwards). 
No photo- or phono-phobia, no nuchal rigidity.


Labs/Studies: of note BUN 21, Cr 1.2, MCV 95, Hct 41.6, wbc 13.3


Neuroimaging: Personally reviewed HCT - mildly large vents, no s/o SDH or SAH or infarct/mass lx/hemorrhage. 


Assessment:: Likely Communicating Hydrocephalus with mild elevation of ICP in context of minor head trauma.  On exam shows psychomotor retardation, d/w concentration, retrieval (including memory and words), frontal fucntions including set-switching on Lurias, and working memory. He also has moderate retropulsion on exam worse on pull-test than spontaneously, and hypomimia. His vents are mildly dilated in context of general cerebral atrophy that is not o/w out-of-proportion for his advanced age. Onset of his sx's including bilateral headache described as constant 6-8/10 pressure at posterior vertex w/ occ. radiation foward made worse by lying down for some time (worse in the mornings) and better in the afternoons or after sitting or standing. No blurred vision but mild nausea w/o vomiting. No nuchal rigidity or photo-phonophobia. No f/c/ns/cp/sob/rash/weakness/changes in sensation. Describes very clear psychomotor retardation since first fall including d/w concentraion, memory and word retrieval, and extreme slowness in mental processing (including reading - used to be a speed reader and now reads one word at a time very slowly). He's had some urinary urgency but no incontinencey. Describes his d/w gait as not being able to get his legs to do what he wants them to do despite having good strength. Additionally, feels that he's always losing his balance backwards. No suggestion of meningoencephalitis, stroke or seizure. Had mild bilat tinnitus but no vertigo. Does ascribe rare very transient visual distortion and object movement (up/down). WBC mildly elevated but no fever and U/A and CXR are negative. 


Overall, there is a diad of gait apraxia and frontal cognitive dysfunction and psychomotor retardation (no urinary incontinence) in context of sx's of mildly elevated ICP and mildly enlarged vents. Has a mild small and large fiber distal symmetric polyneuropathy which exacerbates his gait difficulties. He is also at least mildly anxious and moderately anxious.  Had bradycardia in ED - now better but need to follow. 


Plan: 

- Optimize pain/headache control
- Neuro checks q4hrs
- Cardiac telemetry
- Elevated ICP (mild) precautions with HOB &gt; 45 degrees; and gentle hydration (he is dehydrated by labs)
- MRI of brain to better assess vents and possible transependymal flow, as well as to exclude much less likely brainstem and posterior fossa lesions. Also need to assess posterior circulation w/ MRA (had mild constant tinnutus), and assess for small SDH (b/o h/o head trauma). 
- check B12, homocysteine, TSH, ESR, hsCRP, ANA

- After Brain MRI is reviewed, need to assess fundi, gait and cognition (formally score and time) and then perform diagnostic LP for hydrocephalus -- measuring opening and closing pressure after removing ~ 20cc and sending for cell count, glucose, TP, and xanthochromia as well as keeping ~ 10 cc. 

- Hold sotalol, complete cardiac/MI r/o by enzymes. 
- Follow wbc and monitor for s/s infection. 


Discussed assessment and plan with pt and family who understand and agree.

Reason for Visit	

Annual Physical Exam.



Problems	  

Hypertensive heart disease	      

S:  Pt. has been treated for hypertension since 2064.  When she came to me in 2084 she'd been on Accupril 5 mg. a day, but her BP was 180/80.  Since that time, despite the administration of a variety of antihypertensives, her BP has rarely been normal and she insists that her BP is a function of having come to the doctor. In Mar. 2087 she was hospitlaized with acute congestive heart failure and Lasix was added to her regimen that included at that time Norvasc, Atacand and Atenolol.  Despite some peripheral edema, she continues on this regimen and says that she feels well.  She recently celebrated her 81st Birthday surround by her seven children, and multiple grand- and great-grand children. O: BP 170/80; Heart-- NSR wiohtout murmurs or gallopr.  EKG shows no LVH or strain pattern.  A: Systolic Hypertension.  Patient is reluctant to increase or change her meds. P: Continue present meds and will try and increase her medications on her next visit, a month from now.

Osteoarthritis	      

S:  Pt. takes Indocin intermittently for pain in her hips, neck and hands.  She has a long history of osteoarthritis.

O:  Degenerative joint disease, with changes in hands and legs, and some distortion of the knees.  There is swelling of the joints of the hands, particularly both thumbs, but it does not interfere with her life.A: OA.  P:  Will make no changes at this time.

breast carcinoma	      

S:  The pt. is seven years S/P modified Left radical mastectomy, with 3 of 14 nodes involved, with a poorly differentiated intra-ductal carcinoma. She was T2 M1 N0.  She had been on Tamoxifen 10 mg. b.i.d. for 5 years, but this was d/c'd in March 2086 by Dr. Quy Cherry and she has had not sign of recurrence. She does, however, have a great deal of anxiety about the return of her malignancy and when her daughter found a ""lump"" in her back last week in the course of giving her a massage, she became convinced that her cancer had returned.O:  Well-healed L modified radical mastectomy.  No axillary notes noted.  R breast appears normal.  Pt. gets routine mammograms on the R breast. No lumps or masses were found in or on her back. Chest X-ray today shows no nodular densities.A:  S/P left radical mastectomy for ca. of the breast, with no evidence of recurrence. P:  No further therapy indicated, but Alk. Phos. drawn along with routine chemistries.





Review of Systems	

Patient says that she gets short of breath while climbing up stairs, and cannot walk more than a block or two without getting shortness of breath.  She always has edema in both legs, except when she arises in the a.m. at which time her legs are free of edema.  At the same time, she denies PND and says that she sleeps on only one pillow. She denies chest pain, says that she eats well and has regular BMs.  Her biggest complaint now is urinary pressure and urgency.  She had been using a Pessary for Uterine decensus, but it was removed by Gyn and she was prescribed local Estrogen cream, which has not yet helped.  She was advised to call Gyn for another visit, since she was scheduled about 6 weeks from now.

Dear Dr. Regan: 


I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Percy Root in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Shady Brook Hospital today.  As you know, he is a 70-year-old man who is s/p CABG in May of this year. Today he is doing well folloing his surgery . 



His past medical history is significant for a coronary artery disease, status post IMI,afib,  CABG, PPM,  hypertension, hyperlipidemia, question of an old stroke.  His current medications include aspirin 81 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, lisinorpill 40 mg, Toprol-XL 10 mg, Prilosec 20 mg, Zocor 40 mg, Hydralazine.Coumadin as directed.


Allergies:  No known drug allergies.


He lives in Claxton with his wife, daughter, and grandkids and son-in-law.  He does not drink, smoke or use IV drugs.  He is originally from England.  


Family History:  noncontributory.


On physical examination, his heart rate was 60 and regular,  his blood pressure was 125/70.  Carotids are 2+, good upstrokes, no bruits.  Jugular venous pressure was flat.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  He had a regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border.  Abdomen was benign.  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema of the extremities. Good peripheral pulses.





In summary, this is a 70-year-old man with coronary artery disease,  At this time he is NYHA II. Hre appears a bit volume overloaded. I will add ACE and lasix. Follow up in 1 month.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Qin is a patient of Dr. Potter's, who is in today for urgent care.  He is complaining of a funny sensation in his neck and occasional soreness in his left neck.  Sometimes it hurts worse with breathing.  Sometimes he feels a little catch and a fleeting moment of shortness of breath.  Of note, he was admitted to the hospital last week for these symptoms.  He was admitted, I think 01/15-01/16.  He was ruled out for an MI and actually had a stress test, which showed no evidence of ischemia.  Furthermore, he was monitored the entire time, including while he was having this symptom of a funny feeling in his chest followed by a little shortness of breath or catching his breath as he describes it and no arrhythmia was documented whatsoever.  He was ultimately discharged from the hospital with the diagnosis of Costa chondritis.  He is describing this pain in his left neck and he wonders if it is somehow related to the pain in his chest.  He said he tried gargling with mouthwash some and that did seem to help a little.  This neck or throat pain has been going on for the past three days.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for osteoarthritis, hypertension and other noncontributory problems.



MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, atenolol, Lipitor and vitamin E.



ALLERGIES:  None.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, he is alert and oriented.  His weight is 255.25 pounds, blood pressure 110/80, pulse 68, temperature 97.4.  Sinuses: Non-tender.  Nasal turbinates: Benign.  Tympanic membranes: With good light reflex, landmarks well seen.  Oropharynx: Without erythema, exudate, edema.  Neck: Supple, without adenopathy.  I am able to locate the spot that's bothering him by pressing on the mid outside of his left neck near where his carotid pulse is, but he does not have a lot of discomfort with this pressure and it does not seem to be quite what he is getting at.  Carotids are 2+ bilaterally.  Lungs: Clear to auscultation and percussion throughout.  Heart: Regular, without murmur, rub or gallop.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  I was unable to find a clear etiology for Mr. Quevedo discomfort, although I think he is probably right that it is related to the musculoskeletal chest pain that he is having.  I did reassure him and tell him that it was okay for him to take ibuprofen for this as he had been directed in the hospital.  He does have an appointment to see Dr. Potter in follow-up in the next couple weeks and he will call or return if any new symptoms develop.

Full code



Contact information: 



CC/HPI:  

27yo male from Cedar Hill Lakes, Nevada w/ history of insulin-requiring DM previously followed at Cottage Sanatorium, admitted to Linden Health Care Center after becoming unresponsive during a visit to his sister in Maryland. By report, patient was sitting on the couch at his sister's house, slumped to the floor and had seizure activity x 45seconds that was witnessed by EMS sevices. Accu-checks done at that time were >500 and attempts at intubation were unsuccessful. He was transported to ER, where additional attempts to secure his airway were also unsuccessful, by 2 physicians. There appeared to be some sot of stricture in the upper airway (not obvious on CT scan). However, pt had witnessed emesis, and was placed on 100% nonrebreather mask, with Versed and propofol for sedation with adequate O2 saturation. A x-ray confirmed dependent lung infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia, and pt was started on Clindamycin.



On arrival to the ER, patient was also found to have a blood pressure of 248/146. He received 50mg dose of labetolol in the ER as well as several additional doses in the ICU. In the ICU, patient did not have any further witnessed seizure activity. A Head CT demonstrated no focal lesion, IC hemorrhage or other abnormality. Pt was treated with dilantin and IV insulin infusion. Serum ketones were negative. Additional workup revealed LVH by EKG criteria, as well as renal insufficiency Cr 2.6. Urine tox was positive for benzos, but was otherwise negative.



Patient also developed leukoytosis (WBC ?) with temp of 102 degrees. Although he had minimal neck stiffness by neurology consult exam, he underwent a lumbar puncture that demonstrated a colorless clear fluid, with glucose of 108, TP 44. Grams stain was negative. Tube #4 contained 21RBCs and 7 WBCs with a diff of 96% PMNs and 4% lymphs. CSF cultures and blood cultures were also done, and are pending.



During his hospital course, patient maintained adequate oxygenation with nasal trumpet in place. ABG on 08/25/61 am was 7.36/PCO2 45/ PO2 366, with bicarb of 25 and 100% sats. His FIO2 was subsequently weaned. He remained hemodynamically stable with BP 184/88 (MAP 114) HR100, RR23, 97% on cannula. Cardiac enzymes were negative. After patient's mother arrived from Georgia, she requested transfer to BMH.



Had no reported history of hypertension or seizure disorders. Mother reports patient having occasional spells in the past, lasting 5-10minutes where patient would become non communicative, associated with elevated glucose.

EKG: NSR, borderline LVH

CXR:  perihilar opacities, o/w clear.



Assessment and Plan:  27yo h/o insulin dependent DM, not medically followed, p/w witnessed seizure episode in context of severe hypertension.



1.	Neuro - seizure episode / unresponsiveness with non localizing neuro exam. Concern for hypertensive encephalopathy. Pt had LP at outside hospital which did not suggest meningitis. Other possibilities include infarct, encephalitis. Neurology consulted, with recommendations for:

n	EEG 

n	MRI w/ susceptibility  to evaluate for posterior leukoencephalopathy, MRA head/neck, MRV brain

n Dilantin (continued from OSH)

n	Check tox screen, ammonia. Mother has brought in some unknown pills which we will try to identify.

2.	ID - increased WBC, low grade temp s/p LP. No bacterial source for now, but CXR with opacities suspicious for pneumonia. Will start Vancomycin and cefepime empirically, and narrow per culture results. Concern for encephalitis, as HSV can present w/ HTN and seizures. Will ask Linden Health to add HSV PCR to CSF taken from LP prior to transfer. Start Acyclovir empirically in interim.

3.	Resp - s/p multiple attempted intubations at OSH, currently breathing adequately on RA, with audible obstructive physiology. Given need for MRI, may have to sedate and intubate. Will call anesthesia. Continue intubated until MS more alert, for airway protection. Will start ARDSnet for criteria meeting low PaO2/FIO2 ratio and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.

4.	CV- severe hypertension w/ evidence of potential end organ damage (kidney/brain/cardiac). Will control BP w/ Nipride drip, with addition of labetalol for HR control. Target goal 25% decrease to SPB~160 today, and SBP 120 the following day. Check CK/TPNs. Continue IVF for potential rhabdo.

5.	Renal - Renal failure w/ Cr 2.6, unclear baseline. Suspect acute on chronic component given DM w/ poor follow-up. Will check Urine sediment, lytes to evaluate. Reading by me is +hyaline/waxy casts but no WBC or RBC casts. Kidney U/S pending, also with Doppler to evaluate for RAS. Also check urine renin/aldo and 24hr metanephrine for pheochromocytoma, serum metanephrine, and 24hr protein for nephritic syndrome in presence of HTN and hematuria.

6.	Endo - tight glucose control; CZI drip for DM. Has gap but No ketones at OSH; did not arrive in DKA. Will need reg insulin after drip DC'd in future.

7.	Access - PIV

8.	Prophylaxis - nexium, heparin SQ, peridex, HOB 30.

Re:  Brady Duvall

     MR #425-03-15-1

 

Dear Patricia:

 

I saw Brady Duvall again today.  He has been very stable

clinically over these past six months.  I believe this represents

a composite of the following three major changes in his medical

regimen.  As you know, we have discontinued all beta blockers,

and this has been associated with a symptomatic stability.  He

had biventricular pacing box placed, certainly contributing to

his overall improved status and he is now taking a regular dose

of Lasix.  He is on 80 mg alternating with 40 mg per day.  He

does have symptoms of fatigue, but his overall volume status is

quite reasonable.  He is currently on Aldactone 25 mg daily and

Lasix 80 mg per day alternating with 40 mg per day, Captopril

6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d., Zocor, insulin, Glucophage, aspirin, and

mexiletine.  His amiodarone has been discontinued.  He does have

asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia, often paced out of this,

but I am reluctant to recommend ablation therapy for him at the

present time.  He has not been shocked by his ICD.

 

Functionally he seems quite stable.  He does have mild fatigue,

but is otherwise reasonably active.  He will hopefully be

traveling to Miami this spring.

 

Physical examination today is of note for a weight of 184 lbs. 

His blood pressure is 118/70, his resting pulse 69.  His neck

veins are in fact, quite unimpressive.  There is minimal jugular

distention, perhaps 6-7 cm.  There is no hepatojugular reflux.  

 

 

Re:  Brady Duvall

     MR #425-03-15-1                 -2-                07/18/98

 

Lungs were clear.  Examination of his heart reveals a quiet

precordium.  S1 and S2 seem normal.  No S3, no gallop and no

murmur or mitral regurgitation.  Abdomen is benign without

palpable liver or spleen and there was no peripheral edema. 

There are bilateral varicosities.

 

His electrocardiogram shows pace rhythm.

 

Mr. Brady Duvall is currently stable on this regimen. 

Accordingly, I have made no changes.  I have checked appropriate

electrolytes.

 

Many thanks for letting us participate in his care.

 

With best regards.

 

Sincerely,

 

 

 

U. L. Dana, M.D.

NAME:     Hendrickson, Ora 

MRN:      7194334



This patient is here for a follow-up.  She was seen with a very complete evaluation 

by Ida Oquinn for her recurrent urinary tract infections.  She submitted a

urine sample initially that appeared fairly clean but then after straight cathing her

urine Ida was able to obtain cloudy foul smelling urine.  A fair amount retained

as postvoid residual.  Ms. Hendrickson completed her 14 days of Levaquin with

resolution of her symptoms but now over the past few days she has noticed an odor

and cloudiness to her urine again without fevers of dysuria or urinary urgency.  She

has anxiety associated with the possible reasons why she should have recurrent

infections.  She is most concerned about having cancer.  She is scheduled to see Dr.

Quezada March 24th.  The patient reports increased anxiety of late as there have

been issues going around the housing projects.  A 14-year-old girl was raped and

one week later an individual was climbing a tree to try to get into her apartment. 

She ended up combating him with a broom and he ran away.  She did not file a

police report.  As a result of this she has had more problems with her anxiety.  She

reports compliance with all her medications except that she ran out of her Lasix

approximately one week ago.  She had been taking 20 mg one-half to one tablet

sporadically but not on a regular basis.  She denies any chest pressure or

palpitations.  She denies any shortness of breath.  She denies any problems with

pain in her right foot or increased swelling of her left ankle.



PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure is 156/90.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm. 

No murmurs, gallops or rubs.  UA reveals positive nitrate and 2+ leukocytes.  Her

ankle reveals trace edema on the left.  Her right extremity is warm to palpation.  



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)  Hypertension.  Blood pressure has been high over the past two visits.  This

     may be due to the fact that she has not been taking her Lasix.  I have

     restarted her on the Lasix 20 mg to take one-half tablet q.d. on a regular

     basis.  



(2)  Anxiety.  I will write a letter for her to the Rupert Housing Council to try

     to get her moved out of this current housing project to a safer environment.



(3)  Recurrent urinary tract infections.  She had a urine culture submitted today. 

     She was given another prescription for Levaquin 150 mg one PO q.d.  She

     will stay on this until her appointment with Dr. Quezada.  I attempted to

     reassure her that it is unlikely that cancer is the cause for her current

     recurrent infections.  It is more likely due to her cystocele.



(4)  Peripheral vascular disease.  This appears stable.  She remains off the

     cigarettes.  



(5)  ASCVD.  She remains without symptoms.  



(6)  GERD.  She remains on the Prilosec.



(7)  Hyperlipidemia.  She remains on Lipitor.  She should have a repeat

     cholesterol obtained with a new primary care physician in the fall.



(8)  Borderline high sugar.  The patient should also have this rechecked with the

     new physician in the fall.

   Follow up for Atrial Fibrillation and Positive Nuclear Stress Test


	Interval History:
   January 20, 2079 

Roger Easterling, M.D. 
27 Caroll St, #734 
Bluefield, ME 12111 

Dear Dr. Easterling: 

We had the pleasure of seeing Brian Martin in the Cardiology Service for follow up of atrial fibrillation to discuss findings on recent SESTA MIBI. As you know, he is a 52-year-old male with recent history of palpitations discovered to be atrial fibrillation. Episodes have been associated with chest discomfort, jaw pain and chest thumping and we therefore had him complete nuclear stress test and echocardiogram to R/O structural heart disease. He is on Toprol XL 50 mg and aspirin. SESTA MIBI completed January 5, 2079 after 11 minutes, 13 METS and 90 MPHR was positive ischemia by ECG demonstrated by 2 mm ST depressions in leads II, AVF, and V6 and 2.5 mm ST depressions in leads III and V5. Myocardial scans showed mild anteroseptal and apical ischemia with EF 66%. He had no symptoms and there were occasional VPCs and PACs. Echocardiogram was normal with exception to mildly dilated LA 40 mm. 

Since his last visit he has had two additional of episodes of atrial fibrillation with complaint of rapid heart action, jaw pain and chest discomfort. The episodes lasted approximately 10 minutes and were relieved by rest. He denied lightheadedness, dizziness, pre syncope, syncope, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis. Of note they occurred this time with exercise as opposed to at rest and they seemed more severe in nature.

2. Echocardiogram December 23, 2078. Conclusions: No MVP. LA dilated 40 mm. Aortic valve is tricuspid, no AI. LV cavity size and systolic function is within normal limits without evidence of segmental wall motion abnormalities and EF 76%. Right atrial dilatation. Normal RV. LA 40 mm, LVIDd 50 mm, LVIDs 29 mm, PWT 10 mm, IVS 10 mm and LVEF 76%. 


	Assessment and plan:
   Mr. Martin is a 52-year-old male with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and ischemia noted on recent SESTA MIBI. We have discussed the findings and have recommended proceeding with cardiac catheterization with potential coronary intervention. We have reviewed pre procedural expectations and procedural risk including femoral vascular complications, cardiac perforation, renal complications, stroke, heart attack, and death. He understands and has agreed to proceed. We have also discussed treatment options for atrial fibrillation. He continues to be interested in CRYO Ablation. We have had a long discussion in this regard. We will have to start medication therapy first and then proceed accordingly. His medication options are now limited due to ischemia.  Sotalol is the best option at this time. 

We have spoken to Dr. Nagle who has agreed to complete his catheterization on January 24, 2079. If the dye load is minimal we may decide to complete in patient Sotalol load. We will assess after his angiogram. We have completed pre procedure blood work, CXR and urinalysis. 

We have encouraged him to call with any questions, concerns or changes in health status. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions in regard to his care.

Last seen by PCP 1 mo ago. At that time, he had been complaining of hypoglycemia w/ sugars in the 70's causing him to feel shakey and anxious. Glyburide was stopped, Metformin dose was adjusted from 1000mg bid to 875mg tid. Today he states he has had no hypoglycemic sxs since these changes. He forgot his logbook today. Reports lowest sugar in the 80's, highest 180. Most fastings around 100, randoms 140-150's. He is still walking every day. States his back is ""fine"", no longer painful, though sometimes stiff upon wakening. Has appt at Promptcare for eye exam later this month.

Has gained #14 in 1 month, which he blames on increased stress at home. His cat was injured and recuperating. His mother was recently dx'd w/ ""carcinoma"", but he is unclear of type. He eats when he is stressed. Has not seen psych yet, but states they have been playing ""phone tag"". He continues to have insomnia and finds neither the Prozac or Serax helpful. Depression is stable, but not any better. Would like to change from Prozac to something else. Plans to call psych today and discuss. Denies SI/HI.

HTN managed w/ Lisinopril 40mg and HCTZ 25mg qd added last time. He is tolerating the med w/ no dizziness, CP, SOB, palps, edema. 

Lipids managed w/ Zocor, increased from 20 to 40mg qd last month. He denies myalgias. Has not made appt to see nutrition yet. He is a non-smoker.

Recent significant labs include urine malb/creat 4314, down from 6381. A1c 8.0, down from 10.6 at time of dx.

History of Present Illness Pt. presents today for f/u of her overnight stay in the EDOU from 2/20 to 2/21/67.
 
She went by ambulance on 2/20 when she noted slurred speech and an unsteady gait.  She says it was like she was a drunk.  She hadn't been drinking and hadn't taken or eaten anything unusual.  She was very scared.  No visual changes or other unusual sensations.  She hadn't been sick in any other way:  no fevers, chills, N/V, or other complaints.
 
She felt a tiny bit better and was able to go to the door and let the EMTs in.  They checked her sugar:  63.  They gave her some sugar gel and her Sx resolved.
 
In the ER, her Sx did not reappear.  Labs were notable for BS of 140 then 255.  (A1C on 12/27/66 was 7.8.)  Her Na+ was low @ 124 &amp; 126, but this is stable for her.    She had a normal MRI/MRA.

                                              3-03-66
 
 
 
ID: Mrs. Bird comes in today for a routine check-up.  She is a 
70-year-old female with multiple medical problems including atrial 
fibrillation, status post renal allograft, status post MVR and AVR, on 
Coumadin now, history of CABG in the setting of her valve replacements, 
history of a recent aortic aneurysm repair with some mental status 
diminution after the surgery. 
 
MEDICATIONS: Synthroid, Hydralazine, Lopressor, prednisone, Coumadin, 
Provera, NPH insulin, Neurontin 300mg t.i.d., Imuran 100mg a day, Zocor 
20mg a day, and Digoxin 0.25 alternating with 0.125mg.  She is also 
taking Fosamax 10mg a day and Premarin 0.3mg a day.  
 
The patient is followed closely by a visiting nurse at home.  Her blood 
pressure checks have all been 120-140/70-90 and her blood sugars have 
been running in the morning between 80 and 120 and in the evening from 
150 all the way up to 450.  We have made some adjustments recently in 
her NPH morning dose, and hope to see if this will make a benefit.  
 
Patient notes that she has been feeling generally well, that she has 
been able to fill her cassettes for her medicines, and overall manage her 
medicines without problems.  She does note that she is having some pain 
down her left leg, which she describes as her usual sciatica.  The 
patient has had this on multiple occasions, and it usually waxes and 
wanes over time.  The Neurontin in the past has been very helpful for 
this. 
 
The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, has had no 
fevers or weight loss recently, and has no dyspnea at nighttime. 
 
PHYSICAL EXAM: Notable for a short female in no acute distress, who 
walks with a walker today.  Blood pressure: 144/76.  Pulse: 78 and 
regular.  Her lungs bilaterally are clear to auscultation.   Her heart 
is with sharp click during S1 and S2.  She has got a regular rate and 
rhythm today.  Her abdomen is soft, nontender, with no organomegaly.  
She has got a well-healed abdominal scar. She has got no lower extremity 
edema.  Her musculoskeletal examination is notable for tenderness up 
into the sciatic notch on the left side.  She has got otherwise joints 
that move through a normal range of motion, no swelling or warmth. There 
is no evidence for ecchymoses or petechiae anywhere.  
 
Today will check a hemoglobin A1C, a CBC, and a chem 7 for routine 
monitoring. 
 
My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is doing quite well.   I will 
not make any changes to her medicines until I see her hemoglobin A1C.  I 
suggested that I could give her an injection for her sciatica, but I 
would rather wait because of her anticoagulation, and to see whether it 
remits on it's own.

Lastly, as far as her ability to drive, this has been an issue for the 
last several months since her abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. She is 
clearly doing better from a mental status standpoint, as evidenced by 
her being able to manage her own medications.  I have discussed this 
issue at length with family and her nurse, and everybody is comfortable 
with her trying to drive with someone in the car with her.  I will talk 
to her son, Steven Bird, who lives downstairs, and see whether he or 
his wife could help with trying her out driving first in a schoolyard 
without any people there, and then on less-crowded roads, and then 
finally in a more regular situation.  We will try this over time and see 
how it works, and I will be involved in making any decisions as far as 
letting her drive on her own.

A/P:  28 yo man with DM1, ESRD-HD, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, thrombocytosis, here with hypertensive emergency. His BP has remained high, so will attempt to reduce by 25% MAP for a few hours and then start an oral agent.  Nitroprusside will be used first but if he needs an extended treatment, will change to nicardipine (Bj Q Sugudoyta 1165 Glb;7(9 Kk 1):414-8) given his ESRD.  His change in mental status is likely due to hypertensive encephalopathy, but it is hard to exclude other sources of end-organ involvement such as the heart (especially considering his thrombocytosis) given his ongoing confusion.  Other sources of his confusion might include meningitis given his leukocytosis. 



1.	CV

a.	Pump

i.	Has an S3, but no signs of L or R heart failure.

ii.	Will reduce afterload prog

b.	Rhythm

i.	Sinus tachycardia, will give IVFs to reduce high-reninemic natriuretic state.

c.	Ischemia

i.	No EKG changes consistent with ischemia, will cycle cardiac biomarkers x 3, give ASA, Lipitor.

ii.	Will reduce afterload with Nitroprusside, IVFs, po anti-hypertensives.

2.	Neuro

a.	His mental status and leukocytosis are likely due to hypertensive encephalopathy but potentially concerning for possible meningitis. Will perform lumbar puncture, hold Abx since he has been in the hospital for more than 6h, give if CSF studies indicate it.

b.	Neuro following.

3.	HTN

a.	Will reduce MAP by 25% to ~100, will start with Nitroprusside, switch to Nicardipine. Will re-start some oral agents once reduced.

COLONOSCOPY -  3/31/93 10:00:00 AM

              One sessile polyp with no bleeding was found in the

              transverse colon.  The polyp was three mm in size.

              Polypectomy was performed with a cold snare.  Resection

              was complete.  Retrieval was not done.

              One sessile polyp with no bleeding was found in the

              transverse colon.  The polyp was three mm in size.

              Polypectomy was performed with a cold snare.  Resection

              was complete.  Retrieval was complete.

              Hemorrhoids with no bleeding were found.

              A few diverticula were found in the sigmoid colon and in the

              hepatic flexure.

Impression:   1) Single polyp - three mm.  Complete removal was accomplished.

              3) Hemorrhoids.

              4) Diverticulosis.



     COLON (TRANSVERSE), POLYPECTOMY:

         LOCALIZED AREA OF MILD ACUTE INFLAMMATION WITH CRYPTITIS,

         DYSTROPHIC GOBLET CELLS IN CRYPTS, AND RARE METAPLASTIC PANETH

         CELLS.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

76 year old female with three days of painless BRBPR, also reports of black stool, history of PUD.  Source of bleeding not clear.  Pattern most typical of LGIB, likely diverticular with significant decline in hematocrit, painless, moderate volume BRBPR.  Agree no real pain for ischemic colitis, though wbc elevated.  No fevers, chills, other GI symptoms or exposure for infectious colitis.  Given black stools, aspirin use, history of PUD, upper bleed also possible, though presentation with red blood and hemodynamic stability atypical for this.  Given insecurity in type of bleed, agree with both EGD and colonoscopy.  



EGD and colonoscopy this morning

Hold aspirin

Continue QD PPI

If hematocrit drops further, would transfuse 1-2 units to hct of 28-30

RE:  Christine Olivier
     MR #652-33-21-5
 
Dear Dr. Arteaga:
 
Mrs. Olivier presented to the office today for a second opinion
regarding her current cardiac condition.  As her history is well
known to you, I will repeat it briefly for our records.  Mrs.
Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with a longstanding history of
coronary artery disease.  After several catheterizations in the
2060's which failed to document significant coronary artery disease
(done for evaluation of chest pain), angiogram in July of 2071
showed moderate circumflex coronary artery disease for which she
was managed medically.  However, she suffered a non-Q wave
myocardial infarction on February of 2072 at which time she
underwent cardiac catheterization now showing progressive coronary
artery disease and therefore underwent a multi-vessel coronary
bypass graft operation including a left internal mammary artery to
her LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to her PDA, D1 and obtuse
marginal branch.  She underwent repeat catheterization in February
of 2073 at the Comfrey Clinic which showed diffuse native disease
but apparently no significant bypass graft pathology.  She
underwent repeat cardiac catheterization in May of 2074 because of
a current angina and at this time she had evidence for a 60%
proximal LAD stenosis, a proximal severe circumflex artery stenosis
with no occlusion at the origin at a first obtuse marginal branch
and a 70% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.  The saphenous
vein graft to the diagonal branch was patent with a significant
stenosis at its distal and astigmatic site, a saphenous vein graft
to the second obtuse marginal branch was patent as was the
saphenous vein graft to the posterolateral branch.  The left
intramammary artery to the LAD was a small vessel without discrete
stenoses.  Left ventriculogram demonstrated a moderate area of
posterior basal akinesis with a global ejection fraction of 60%. 
She therefore was transferred to the Midwest Eire Center
in early June where she underwent successful PTCA of her vein graft
to her diagonal artery.  She tolerated this uneventfully and was

discharged and since then has not had significant exertional chest
discomfort.  Her primary complaint is one of fatigue and mild
exertional dyspnea.  She has undergone extensive pulmonary
evaluation in the past including pulmonary function tests which
have revealed an FEV1 of 1.3 which is 59% predicted, and an FVC of
1.5 which is also 55% predicted giving her a pattern consistent
with restrictive rather than obstructive pulmonary disease.  In
addition, she has a history of a seizure disorder, diabetes,
hypertension and a nonspecific peripheral neuropathy.  
 
Medications at present:  NPH insulin 60 units sub q qAM, CZI
insulin 30 units sub q qAM, NPH insulin 60 units sub q qPM, enteric
coated aspirin one tab po q.d., atenolol 50 mg po b.i.d., Captopril
25 mg po t.i.d., amlodipine 5 mg po q.d., simvastatin 10 mg po
q.d., nitroglycerin prn, Nitropatch .2 mg for twelve hours of a
twenty-four hour period, Neurontin 300 mg one tab po t.i.d.,
Trusopt one drop ou q.d., Alantin one drop ou q.h.s. and albuterol
inhalers two puffs q.i.d. prn.
 
Cigarettes - none at present.  
 
Physical exam reveals a well-nourished mildly overweight woman in
no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 140/70, heart
rate 75 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 172
pounds.  The neck is supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2+ without
significant bruits.  Chest is clear with a trace right basilar
rhonchi.  Cardiac exam shows a normal S1, physiologically split S2
and a I-II/VI systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to
the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is
benign with bowel sounds well heard.  Extremities without
appreciable edema.  Peripheral pulses are intact.  There is 1+
bipedal edema. 
 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 75.  PR interval
of .14, QRS .08, QT .34, axis -20 degrees.  There is evidence of a
left atrial abnormality and poor R wave progression in leads V1
through V3.  
 
Impression:  Mrs. Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with significant 
atherosclerosis, diabetes and now a chief complaint of modest
exertional dyspnea and fatigue.  She denies any active chest
discomfort and apparently her recent angioplasty was successful at
alleviating the chest pain syndrome.  The records available to me
indicate that there is no continued efforts to diminish her beta
blocker therapy however in the past this had lead to an
exacerbation of her angina.  However, now that she is status post
her PTCA it is possible she now again will tolerate beta blocker
reduction and therefore, I suggested she decrease her atenolol to
50 mg po q.d.  She will have her blood pressure checked within the
next several days and assuming she remains asymptomatic, I will

also try diminishing her amlodipine in part because of peripheral
edema and in part because she may no longer need this.  Otherwise,
I have made no specific alterations to her medical regimen except
to encourage her to continue her aerobic activity level as best she
can and watch her saturated fat and cholesterol intake and stay in
close contact with you should her chest pain syndrome at all recur. 
I would be happy to assist in her management in any way you deem
appropriate.

MR #657-72-75-7

A follow up visit of a 57-year-old white male.  Unfortunately, he
arrived 24 hours late.  
 
He is gradually recovering from a recent flare of his COPD.  This
started with an upper respiratory infection.  He called over the
weekend and was started on prednisone.  He continued to have a
stuttering course over the course of that following week and came
to urgent care the following weekend.  There he was treated with
nebulizers.  He reports that today he was finally able to blow 350
on his peak flow meter.  He is still bringing up lots of junk.  His
gout has been quiescent.  
 
Medications:  Albuterol.  Azmacort.  Colchicine.  Enalapril.  
 
Allergies:  None.
 
Social History:  Married.  His adoption of a 10-year-old girl named
Xiao has been finalized.  He is employed as a sales representative and that
requires a lot of lifting and carrying.  He quit smoking three and
a half years ago.  He drinks no alcohol.
 
Physical Examination:  Looks well.  His weight is 222 pounds.  His
blood pressure is 124/82.  Pulse 76.  HEENT:  EOMI.  No scleral
icterus.  No lymphadenopathy.  His lungs are completely clear
posteriorly and anteriorly.  Distant heart sounds without any
audible murmurs.  Benign abdomen without any hepatomegaly.  No
rectal masses.  Normal prostate.  Guaiac negative stool.  No pedal
edema.  
 
Oxygen saturation on room air is 97 percent.  Peak flow is 320. 
 
Impression: 
1.  COPD.  We discussed this at length.  I think the crucial
component to his treatment will be to anticipate when he is going
to have a flare and responding quickly in a preventative fashion. 
We will have him check his peak flows at the same time every day. 
When he is feeling well his peak flows are always in the 350 range
and he reports that they never go to 300.  When it hits 300 he
should call me or if it is the weekend, he should start immediately
on prednisone 40 mg a day.  
2.  Gout.  Doing well on colchicine.  
3.  Hypertension.  Well controlled.  I will check a creatinine.
4.  General health.  We will check a cholesterol.  His cholesterols
have been good in the past but he has a slightly low HDL.

Re: Nancy Xayarath

ANC Unit #:  111-64-17



Dear Dr. Townsend:



	I had the pleasure of seeing Nancy Xayarath today with regards to callus formation over the plantar aspect of her left foot.



	As you are aware, she is a 57-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and Charcot arthropathy of her left foot that has resulted in a rocker bottom deformity.  She currently wears accommodative orthotics typical for somebody with her deformity.  She has noted that perhaps over the last two weeks or so that a callus has formed under the plantar lateral aspect of the left foot. She denies any drainage, erythema, or increased swelling or warmth in the foot.  Her orthotics were made in September and seem to be working quite well for her. She admits however that over the last month and half or so that she has been wearing boots that her current orthotics do not fit in. Apparently, she has had to resort to her old orthotics, which did not take her Charcot deformity into account.  



	Her past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. Her medications include Prograf, prednisone, Prilosec, an aspirin a day, Imdur, calcium supplement, a multi vitamin, Lantus insulin, and Humalog with meals.  She takes Imuran, Coumadin, and Toprol XL, as well as Lipitor.  Her past surgical history is significant for colostomy in 2094, fistula repair in 2095, coronary artery bypass surgery times four in 2096, a kidney transplant in 2097, and a fistula ligation in 2098.  She quit smoking ten years ago and has no known allergies to medications.

	

	Physical examination is centered mainly around her left foot.  She has diminished sensation to ten-point examination with a Semmes-Weinstein 5.05 monofilament.  She has multiple toe amputations, all of which have healed nicely. She does have a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse.  The skin is of normal turgor. She has no active plantar ulcers on

either foot. At the apex of her rocker bottom deformity on the left side there is a callus that I d  brided in the office underlying which is a grade 0 ulcer.  



	No new x-rays were obtained today.



	Diagnosis: Grade 0 ulcer, diabetic left foot.



	Plan:  She has not reached the dermis on her left foot, however, should she continue to weight-bear without mechanical off-loading it is only a matter of time before this develops into a grade I ulcer.  It is unclear to me whether the culprit is an orthotic that needs to be remolded or the fact that she has been wearing boots with an inappropriate orthotic.  I am going to have her see Samantha Albright, our orthotist to have the insoles remolded with Plastizote.  I have asked Ms. Xayarath to bring the shoes that she typically wears as well as the boots she wears.  We will follow this development closely as Ms. Xayarath is perfectly aware of the potential downsides of forming an ulcer. She knows to contact me if she has any questions or concerns in the meantime. Thank you kindly for this referral.



Best personal regards,

Re:  Kenneth Umstead
     MR#  401-10-87-8
 
Dear Jac:
 
I saw your patient Kenneth Umstead in the Cardiology Office today and
he feels he has actually improved.  His primary limitation had been
his claudication, but he feels that he can walk better now than in
the past.  We had a repeat evaluation of his segmental leg pressure
and volumes, and these actually were unchanged from a prior study
two years ago.  The post volume recordings were normal in each leg. 
Systolic pressure gradients were present in the right leg
consistent with mild anterior tibial/dorsalis pedis disease.  No
systolic pressure gradients were found in the left leg.  These were
unchanged from January, 2072.  Mr. Umstead feels that he can be more
physically active and is less limited.
 
His current medical regimen includes Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d.,
Nifedipine XL 60 mg q.d., and Lasix 20 mg q.d.
 
Of note, in October, 2073, he was found by colonoscopy to have four
polyps which were removed.  Apparently, no malignant cells were
seen in the pathologic specimens.
 
On exam, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 122/68, heart
rate 63 and regular, weight 205 lbs.  HEENT unremarkable.  Chest
was clear.  Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distention at 30
degrees, PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 normal but physiologically
split.  There was an S4 and a I/VI systolic ejection murmur at the
lower left sternal border.  Abdominal exam was unremarkable. 
Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.
 
His resting 12 lead EKG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm, left axis
deviation, and persisting X waves across the precordium consistent
with his left anterior hemiblock.
 
I think Mr. Umstead is doing quite well.  He asked that I see him
again in six months for routine re-evaluation, and I would be happy
to do so. If any problems develop in the interim please don't
hesitate to contact me.  Thank you for allowing me to participate
in his care.

                     PMH EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT
 
WESTYN-NUEL,KELLI   898-97-85-6            VISIT DATE: 02/13/79
This patient was seen with Dr. Quilla Uehara, an Emergency 
Medicine resident.  The PRESENTING COMPLAINT, HISTORY OF PRESENTING 
COMPLAINT, PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, MEDICATIONS, ALLERGIES, SOCIAL 
HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, and REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted on the 
record by Dr. Uehara, and as reviewed with the patient and with Dr. 
Uehara.  Briefly, the patient is a pleasant 64-year-old woman, who 
has had episodes of severe left-sided pressure-like chest pain off 
and on through the course of this week.  This has occurred with 
exertion and has always cleared with rest.  She is pain-free at 
present, but presents to the Emergency Department because she 
reported to her family that she had ceased taking her high blood 
pressure medications. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The physical examination is as noted by Dr. 
Uehara.  Basically, the examination is completely normal with the 
exception of the blood pressure, which ranges from 220 to 230 over 
100 to 110.  The patient's electrocardiogram does not show acute 
changes. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The cardiac troponin I is 0.53. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  I concur with Dr. Uehara that the 
patient has a strong history for unstable angina.  The patient will 
be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation.  She has 
remained pain-free while in the Emergency Department and has 
received nitroglycerin paste.  Her blood pressure will be treated 
with initiation of an ACE inhibitor. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Unstable angina. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 
admitted to the hospital in satisfactory condition.

IDENTIFICATION:  This 65-year-old man with a 5-year history of cardiomyopathy is is admitted with worsening heart failure and recent presyncope for further evaluation.  He was diagnosed with progressive shortness of breath in 2078.  He was treated with diuretics and other medications at that time.  He did quite well until December of last year when he had a cardiac arrest and underwent ICD placement.  He has had worsening symptoms over the last year with increasing shortness of breath on flat ground and a very severe shortness of breath with stairs.  He has had some episodic nature to this.  Two days prior to admission, he had relatively rapid onset of shortness of breath while trying to play pool.  This recurred several times associated with diaphoresis.  He had no palpitations at that time.  He has no chest discomfort.

His past medical history is significant for history of shower emboli and TIA in 2081.  He has diabetes.  He had spinal stenosis surgery in 2078.

His current medical regimen is Bumex 3, recently decreased from 12 due to worsening renal function.  He is on spironolactone described as 6.25 daily, digoxin 0.125, Toprol-XL 12.5.  He has been on carvedilol, which was changed due to dizziness.  He is on lisinopril 1.25 mg and has had great difficulty tolerating any higher dose due to dizziness.  He is on metolazone 2.5 weekly.  He takes Coumadin 7.5 mg most days.  He is on insulin and Lantus.  He has no known drug allergies.

His family history is essentially unremarkable.  Mother unknown, father had onset of angina in his 80s.  The patient lives with his wife and son and is a retired Fire Chief.  He had an 80-pack-year smoking history but quit four years ago.  He has one glass of alcohol every 1-2 weeks.

Review of systems is negative for any problems with fevers, chills, change in his bowel or bladder habits.  He has no problems with swallowing.  He has no problems with hearing or vision.  Review of systems is otherwise negative.

On physical examination, blood pressure is 84/66 in the left arm and 86/62 in the right arm.  His chest is completely clear to auscultation and percussion.  Temperature is 35.9.  His heart rate is 100 and a regular rhythm.  His cardiac exam reveals left ventricular heave, which is visible.  He has a palpable and audible third heart sound.  The right ventricular impulse is present also.  He has a systolic murmur, which is heard everywhere, not otherwise easy to characterize.  It does not change with respiration.  The second component of the second sound is slightly increased in radiation consistent with a PA systolic pressure in the range of 50-60.  His legs are cool.  Venous pattern is very prominent.  His pulses are intact peripherally.  He has no abdominal bruits.  His jugular venous pressure is 14 cm.  He has no cervical adenopathy or thyromegaly.  His liver percusses at approximately 5 cm below the costal margin.  He has some increased resonance around the umbilicus.  Laterally, there is suggestion of some fluid in the distention.  There is no peripheral edema.  His joints are without obvious deformities, although he describes arthritis in his shoulder, neck, and back.  He has no skin rashes or sores, several very small ecchymoses.  His standing blood pressure is unchanged.  He has atrially triggered ventricular pacing at 98.

ASSESSMENT:
1.  Etiology of left ventricular dysfunction is undetermined.  We do not know information of recent catheterization or echocardiography.  The degree of his mitral disease is not clear.  He clearly did not have coronary artery disease on one studied initially.  However, the episodicity is significant.
2.  Current hemodynamic status shows marked volume overload and low cardiac output, and is cold and wet pattern.  His history of recent diuretic use suggests that he may have had relatively rapid onset of fluid after his last diuretic change.  However, the episode while playing pool also raises the possibility of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia undetected.  It is also possible that this is related to angina.
3.  Other related risks.  He is on Coumadin due to his embolic shower before.  It is possible that he has had other emboli, possibly even to coronary arteries leading to recent decline in function.

There are no obvious contraindications to transplant.  At this time, we are not planning to evaluate him but to treat the urgency of his heart failure decompensation.  Our plan is to hold his beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for now, and to begin him on an IV diuretic infusion.  We will proceed with echocardiogram and catheterization if necessary to determine whether there are other conditions exacerbating his current decompensated state.

Dear Dr. Nunes:
 
Thank you for asking me to see Mr. Craft. Patient says he was diagnosed 
as having neuropsychiatric lupus in 2103 at the Vermilion Hospital by Dr. Parker 
Xian and was treated with steroids at the time. It's not clear what CNS 
or neuropsychiatric manifestation he had at the time. Because of complex 
partial seizures he was seen by Dr. Arce at the Livingstone Homes who 
referred him to Dr. Hoffman at the Livingstone Homes who said that his 
estradiol level was in the 80s. His testosterone was up but available 
testosterone was down so he was put on Clomid and testolactone which he 
said turned off the lupus and turned off his seizures. Said he was doing 
fine until around 2 weeks ago when he felt that his lupus recurred. He 
said his neck felt full and warm. His head felt like it was going to 
explode. He had tinnitus, excess saliva, he felt that his lower jaw was 
vibrating and when he lay on his pillow his neck felt like it wasn't 
right. Also about the time he developed a cold with runny nose and 
postnasal drip. Lab work on February 8 showed a normal CBC, urine, and 
anti-DNA (in 2103 his ANA was positive at 1:1024 but I don't have any 
other results). He's had no fevers, no rashes other than a folliculitis 
on his legs. No new problem with head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, teeth 
or gum except that he has to wear his glasses. Recently had some teeth 
removed. Has a postnasal drip with a little bit of a cough. No other 
cardiorespiratory problems but takes Altace for mild hypertension. No GI 
problems. Has urinary frequency due to nocturia ever 2 hours, due to 
benign prostatic hypertrophy and recently had a TUR. Dr. Nunes

A PSA has been normal. Past history of kidney stones. He's allergic to 
penicillin, Lozol, allopurinol and bee venom. Has a past history of 
diagnosis of gout versus pseudogout. Sleeps fine. No history of fractures. 
Only operation is a total knee replacement on the left for arthritis and 
appendectomy. Bruises easily, frequently has headaches. Has been diagnosed 
as being bipolar. Exercises.
 
Recent MRI consistent with a ""vasculopathy.""
 
Family history. Mother died of colon cancer at 62, smoked. Father died 
at 62 of heart attack, stroke and insulin dependent diabetes, also 
smoked. He is an only child.
 
Social history. Doesn't smoke. When he's depressed he becomes a binge 
drinker. Exercises when he's not depressed. He's retired since 2103. Was 
a stage manager.
 
Physical exam. Somewhat overweight gentleman. Blood pressure was 160/80. 
Pulse was 88 and regular. Skin, a hint of livedo reticularis on 
forearms, and a couple of infected hair follicles around his knees. One 
small node in the left side of his neck. Mouth and throat was clear. 
Bilateral nasal polyp more on the right than left. Ear drums fine. 
Hearing fine (tuning fork in the middle of the forehead was heard in the 
forehead). Chest clear. No CVA tenderness. Heart: No murmurs. Abdomen, 
no organs, masses, tenderness but obese. Extremity, joint exam fine. 
Neurological fine.
 
I do not think that his lupus has acted up but think most of his current 
symptoms could be explained by an upper respiratory tract infection. 
However, I suspect he might have the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome 
and therefore have tested him for that, and also for complement level to 
also exclude lupus and vasculitis. Basically I told him to take Flonase 
twice a day until his ringing in the ear cleared up and postnasal drip 
cleared up. 
 
In the meantime continue on the Lamictal 100 mg twice a day as a 
stabilizer, Risperdal 0.25 mg per day as a mood stabilizer, the 
testolactone 50 mg 4 times a day to increase the availability of 
testosterone, the Clomid (clomiphene citrate) 50 mg per day to decrease 
estradiol, Levoxyl 50 mcg twice a day, Altace 10 mg twice a day regarding 
hypertension, and ibuprofen 800 mg twice a day for low back pain. Patient 
also gave me 2 pages of notes similar to what he had including comments 
regarding increased appetite, decreased memory,

decreased cognitive function, decreased balance, fatigue, decreased 
hearing, a history of carotid sinus, hypersensitivity, question of 
cholinergic transmission problems.
 
Also should be noted that a lot of his symptoms coincided with taking 
Aricept to improve his memory. Took it for 10 days and hasn't taken it 
for 2 weeks but his symptoms persisted. 
 
Thank you again for asking me to see him. Please let me know if I can be 
of further assistance. 
 
Sincerely yours,

PS: If you could give me some information of what evidence there was 
that he had systemic lupus and neuropsychiatric lupus back in 2103 at 
the Vermilion Hospital, for instance the discharge summary from the Vermilion Hospital, that would be appreciated.

HPI:

65 yo male with PMH significant for DM, autonomic dysfunction, CRI, depression and arthritis who was admitted for progressive lower back pain.  He has had LBP for at least three years which is located in his mid lumbar region, non radiating, worse with standing.  The pain had progressed such that he has a very poor performance status. He cannot stand but for a few minutes at a time.  He denies focal wekness.   He had an MRI of the LS spine 2/02/47 which revealed heterogeneous marrow concernig for an infiltrating process in his marrow.   He has had an SPEP which was normal, he has had a bone scan which was negatvie. He does not have an elevated protein or globulin fraction. His CRI is longstanding  and attributed to his DM.  He was set up for a outpt BM bx to evaluate the marrow process, but the pain has been so severe, he was admitted for an inpatient work up.  Of note he has longstanding anemia related to his CRI, perhaps anemia of chronic disease.  He denies any weight loss, fevers, chills, night sweats, decreased appetite. He does report fatigue which has become progressive.

MRI 1/47: heterogenous bonemarrow uptake in vertebrae and pelvis, concerning for infiltrative process



Imp/Plan:

Mr. Tuttle is a 65 year old male with a three year hisotry of porgressive lower back pain, non-radicualr in nature. The pain has progressed to a significant level such that he spends most of his day in bed.  He did have an MRI of the L/S spine which was negative except it did reveal heterogeous uptake in the vertebral and pelvic bone marrow. They raised the question of multiple myeloma or another infiltrative process. He does have renal insufficiency, but no other abnormalities to suggest MM. We still need a few key pieces of data to rule this out. Other infiltrative processes such as malignancy from elsewhere should be excluded.  In addition, he has a hx of a positive PPD, unclear if he actually had active TB or was treated prophylactically. Is any of this TB?  Recommend:

-- skeletal survey

-- quantitative urine bence jones proteins as there are  non-secretory myelomas

-- beta-2 microglobulin

-- reticulocyte count

-- consider chest CT to r/o lung cancer given his history of tobacco

-- guaiac all stools

-- Will review the MRI with radiologist to get a better differential

-- Consider BM biopsy next week, unfortunately will not be able to perform today. 

-- Will review smear and staff with Dr. Landry in the afternoon.

Thank you for this consult.

Dear Dr. Knapp:



It was our pleasure to care for Mr. Osborne to help with his decompensated heart failure.  He was admitted on 07/23/2082, one month after previous admission for abdominal pain.  In retrospect, that admission may have been related in part to GI symptoms of heart failure.  He came in complaining of continued GI discomfort, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, and 9 pounds of weight gain with increasing abdominal girth.  His medications at the time of admission included beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for hypertension, with no diuretics.



During his hospitalization, he underwent 7.5 kilograms of diuresis with resolution of his jugular venous pressure from approximately 25 cm to 8 cm.  His echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 20% with LV dimension of 5.1, enlarged right ventricle with mild decrease in RV function, but severe RV pressure overload with estimated PA pressure 80 plus the right atrial pressure.  After he had his diuresis, he underwent right heart catheterization, which revealed a right atrial pressure of 8, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18, PA pressure of 65/35.  He underwent a trial with IV nitroglycerin, then with sildenafil.  The IV nitroglycerin decreased his BLANK pressures only by approximately 8-10 mm but he noted a further improvement in his dyspnea.  There was no clear improvement with the sildenafil in either his symptoms or hemodynamics.  His cardiac output varied between 3.1 and 4.5 on all the medications.  The decision was just to put him on oral nitroglycerin in addition to the other standard heart failure medications.  He also underwent a MIBI looking for any evidence of active ischemia, which there was none.



At the time of discharge, he is walking easily without postural change or symptoms.  His medications are Isordil 10 t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.  He is on Toprol-XL 12.5 daily.  His lisinopril was decreased from 40 mg to 20 mg, but should he have any problems with hypotension, this could certainly be decreased further to 10 or even 5 mg if necessary to allow him comfortable ambulation.  He is on Plavix 75 mg daily as well and simvastatin 40.  His discharge blood pressure is 102/60, jugular venous pressure is 8-9 cm.  His creatinine is 1.3 with a BUN of 44, hematocrit 40, white blood count 5000, potassium 3.9, sodium 139.



It has been my great pleasure to participate in his care.  He is trying very hard to learn how to manage his disease at home, with the help of his family.  We have emphasized not only the salt restriction but also a fluid restriction to 2 liters a day, which includes all fluids,   We would encourage him to resume his daily exercise such as walking.  He has an appointment to see Dr. Anderson on 08/20/2081, and is looking forward to returning to your care. 



 I would be happy to answer any further questions about it.



Sincerely,

INFECTIOUS DISEASE ASSOCIATES
CURTIS MEDICAL CENTER

Reason for visit   Brucellosis

History of present illness   70y/o F who presented in late May with daily fever x 2-3 months with low back pain x 2 weeks, admitted May 30 and found to have small gram negative rod bacteremia consistent with Brucellosis, which fits with her epidemiologic exposure to unpasteurized camels milk and her prolonged fever. There was initial concern for TB, but she ruled out for pulmonary tb with 3 negative smears. PPD positive. 

She had an MRI of her spine that was initially read as L5/S1 diskitis/osteomyelitis with right paraspinal phlegmon . MSK radiologists felt that this actually represented degenerative change with no evidence of infection, with explanation that a large right-sided osteophyte is causing irritation. 

Mrs. Iles declined a TEE on during her admission. 

She was treated with streptomycin IM q daily x 2 weeks,and concurrent doxycycline 100 mg po bid plus rifampin 300 mg po tid. 

She was seen in ID clinic on 7/20, 9/7, 11/9, and today (1/4/81). She has improved dramatically, and is able to walk independently without pain. She has no fevers, night sweats, weight loss, nausea, or vomiting. Her pain is well controlled minimal medications.

Past medical history   -DMII (dx late 60s, last A1c = 5.6 in 2/80) 
-HTN 
-Hyperlipidemia 
-Hep B sAb+, sAg+, and core Ab+ in 2067; now sAg-, sAb+, and core Ab (+) in 2/2080 ( recovery ) 
-H/o H. pylori (+) 2068 and 2080 s/p triple therapy 
-GERD 
-OA 
-H/o vitamin D deficiency 
-H/o chronic HAs (migraines vs. tension HAs) 
-+ PPD (in Mississippi in 2067) 
-H/o malaria

Social history   No tobacco, EtOH, illicits. Currently living with daughter in Grand Island. No pets. No known sick contacts. 

Changes to Allergies
NKA: No Known Allergies - reaction: [reviewed]

Review of systems   Denies fever, rigor, night sweats, headache, SOB, cough, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, paresthesias, or rash.

Physical Exam
General appearance   NAD
Skin   No rashes
HEENT   No palpable LN, no oral lesions
Cor   S1 S2, no murmurs, no peripheral stigmata of endocarditis
Abdomen   Non tender, BS+, No palpable organomegaly
Extrem   No clubbing, mild edema at the ankles
Musc skel   No tenderness on the lower back percussion. Normal gait.

Assessment and plan   70 yr F with confirmed Brucella bacteremia from May 30/31 2080 and probable Brucella diskitis/osteomyelitis at the L5/S1 level. She presented with a syndrome of constitutional symptoms and back pain of 3 months duration, and has improved dramatically after 2 weeks of streptomycin IM (completed), rifampin 300 mg po tid, and doxycycline 100 mg po bid. Her antibiotics started on 6/4/80 and will be discontinued today 1/4/81 after 6 months of therapy. 

She was counseled today that she is to watch out for recurrence of infection, which may include fever, night sweats, weight loss, anorexia, worsening back pain, and fatigue. She knows to contact us should this occur. 

She was counseled to not drink unpasteurized camel milk.

In addition, Mrs Iles is PPD positive: she has completed the required 4 months of therapy for latent TB (she had 6 months) as part of the treatment of her Brucella infection. 

All Allergies Reviewed
	

Ms. Iles was seen and examined with Dr. Tillman. Her back pain, fevers, and weight loss have entirely resolved. She has finished six months of doxy/rif and should stop these medications. We asked her to return for any new back pain, fevers, or weight loss.

Office Visit

 

Re: Larry Lockwood

MPC# 590-33-20-3

 

 

This is a 56 year old morbidly obese male who was discharged recently from 

the 

Marshalltown Pond Clinic who is here for follow up of his newly diagnosed 

diabetes mellitus. He was seen in the emergency room on 10/21 with the 

complaint of urinary frequency, hesitancy, and generally not feeling well. 

Prior to that, he had been treated with antibiotics by his primary care 

physician for a urinary tract infection with Bactrim and then ampicillin but 

he did not get better. He went to the emergency room and was admitted to the 

hospital because his blood sugar was in the 400s and he was diagnosed with 

diabetes at that time. He was discharged on 10/22/78 on insulin NPH 30 units 

in 

the morning and 15 units in the PM and was advised to follow up in the 

outpatient clinic today. Since discharge, his blood sugars have been in the 

200s. This afternoon, it is 242 2 hours after his last meal.

 

Past Medical History: He has a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy. He 

sees a urologist and they are discussing a new procedure for the same. He 

cannot have ______ because of his morbid obesity, he cannot be positioned on 

the table for the same. He also gives a history of sleep apnea. No 

hypertension. He does have a history of gastric reflux and obesity.

 

Past Surgical History: He has had bilateral hip surgery for slipped ______ as 

an adolescent.

 

Review of Systems: No chest pain. Positive review of systems for UTI symptoms 

with increased frequency and hesitancy. Other review of systems-he has 

arthritis generalized with more pain in the hip. Also has acid reflux.

 

Family History: Family history of obesity and hypertension but no diabetes or 

coronary artery disease.

 

Social History: He is a smoker but is trying to quit. He smokes less than one 

pack a day. He is a manager and is on disability. He has 2 children and is 

separated.

 

Physical Examination: He is morbidly obese and weighs about 405 pounds. Blood 

pressure 110/88. Pulse 84. Skin exam-there is evidence of acanthosis 

nigricans. He has gynecomastia. Head and neck exam-atraumatic, normocephalic. 

Extraocular movements are intact. Pupils equal, round and reactive to light. 

Cardiovascular system exam-S1, S2 heard. No S3, S4. Respiratory system-clear 

to auscultation and percussion. No added sounds. Abdomen-obese, very 

difficult 

to examine for masses or hepatosplenomegaly. On limited exam, there are no 

masses palpable. CNS-cranial nerves II-XII intact. Examination of feet with 

monofilament is negative as he is not able to feel the monofilament in both 

feet. This impairment is greater on the right foot than left.

 

Labs done so far:  hemoglobin A1c of 14, glucose on 10/21 422, creatinine 1.7, 

BUN 22, sodium 132, potassium 4.5, chloride 97, liver function tests with ALT 

10, AST 10, alkaline phosphatase 126, bilirubin 0.4, total protein 8.1, 

albumin 3.6, globulin 4.5, calcium 9.5, hemoglobin 15.

 

Assessment and Plan: 1. New onset diabetes mellitus. The patient is morbidly 

obese, has features of insulin resistance. His blood sugars today are better 

since admission. He is on insulin twice a day. He checks his blood sugars 3 

times a day and since discharge, they have been around 240 to 300. The 

patient 

is not a good candidate for metformin with his last creatinine of 1.7. He may 

be a candidate for Avandia. At the present time, his alkaline phosphatase is 

mildly elevated but his ALT and AST are normal. He has difficulty coming to 

the clinic and would prefer to have his visiting nurse and nutritionist 

communicate with the clinic physicians to adjust the dose of his insulin and 

also have his blood tests done locally rather than here in the clinic. We 

will 

increase his NPH to 40 units in the morning and 26 units in the PM. We will 

work with the visiting nurse and nutritionist to adjust the insulin dose and 

also order lab tests. We will repeat his hemoglobin A1c in a month and also 

repeat his creatinine and liver function tests at that time to see if he may 

be a candidate for Avandia. I advised the patient to return to the clinic in 

6 

months and also for him to send the blood sugar results every week until his 

blood sugars are under better control.

HPI

78 yo F with PMHx sig for CHF, HTN, atrial fibrillation (cardioverted 2/68, now on amiodarone), and DM p/w increased SOB and chest pain over 1 weeks time.  Symptoms not related to exertion and reports sternal area is the location of pain.  Occurs at rest. Feels like pressure and at times sharp pain, not related to respiration. 7/10 when maximal intensity.  Pain is constant in nature, patient states lasting up to hours at a time.  No specific provocative or palliative factors.  Not related to position.  Reports that SOB and chest pain are chronic problems for her and the reason she presented to the ED is because the symptoms have increased over the past week.



No associated symptoms of N/V or diaphoresis.  Reports occasional palpitations.  Patient also feels pain in her back, shoulders, and arms which she attributes to her arthritis and not radiation of the pain.  States that she sleeps on 4 pillows and this does represent on acute change.



Denies fever/chills.  Reports constipation at baseline (BMs do not occur everyday). Patient states she has    frequent sinus infections.

Pulmonary embolism - bilateral, treated at Buzan County Clinic (CT with multiple filling defects in LLL, RUL, RLL c/w PE), non-Q wave MI with inferolateral apical depressoins at Buzan County Clinic 6/69; RSH admission 5/17/70 with D-dimer=1976, CT negative for PE and DVT

Osteoarthritis, anxiety, depression with psychotic features, lumbar disc disease (s/p surgical repairs), 

Echo: 5/21/70: The left ventricular systolic function within normal limits.  There is segmental left ventricular dysfunction which involves the inferior territory, this has deceased sine 12/68 study. The estimated ejection fraction is 57%. Estimated RV systolic pressure is 89 mmHg. Right ventricular systolic function is within normal limits.



Stress The ECG response to pharmacological stress was  uninterpretable for ischemia. The myocardial scans are within normal limits and do not demonstrate evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction. Region(s) with apparent reduction in tracer activity likely reflect soft tissue attenuation, not specific for coronary artery disease. LVEF=64%.





PE protocol CT 5/70: no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Delayed venogram of the pelvis and lower extremities demonstrates no evidence of of DVT.

A 2.2 x 1.4 cm nodule is identified on image 112 in the right upper lobe.  In addition, there is ground glass opacity involving the bilateral lungs.  There is interstitial pulmonary edema and a small right pleural effusion.

Assessment and Plan



78F h/o CHF (diastolic dysfunction), Afib (s/p cardioversion), HTN, DM, past b/l PE presents with increased CP and SOB times week. Differential includes CHF exacerbation (? Setting of med noncompliance), ACS, PE.



1)PE - D-dimer is 2257; Heparin 6000 unit bolus, 1000 unit/hr with sliding scale; PE protocol CT;

Continue to hold Metformin, received 600mg Mucomyst in preparation for dye load and continue 2 doses post scan; Preliminary CT read: no evidence of PE although limited by motion artifact; ground glass changes c/w with CHF; Continue Heparin as pt. with h/o PE and awaiting final CT read.



2) r/o MI - Enzymes negative x2; ASA, O2; B-blocker continued (no evidence of systolic dysfunction); Received ACE (Zestril x1), now hold in setting of dye load



3) CHF - strict I&Os, daily weight, no salt diet; exam reveals slight fluid overload, after initial diuresis (Lasix 20 IV x2) will hold in light of CT w contrast, monitor fluid status, no IVF at this time



4) DM - hold Metformin, on Insulin SS with bid coverage



5) Urine - negative nitrite/WBC, sediment 5-10 WBCs, few bacteria; Likely asymptomatic bacteruria in elderly patient, afebrile, no increased WBC, therefore no treatment at this time.

 

Prophylaxis: 

-- Nexium



Dispo: 

-- Ambulate, PT/OT



Code: 

-- Unknown

	Interval History:

   Ms. Kong presents to follow-up her recent hospitalizations.  Briefly, she was admitted in early April with Group B strep bacteremia and AoV endocarditis with mod to severe AI.  The source of GBS bacteremia remains unclear although she had an episode of shingles a few weeks prior and may have caused a cutaneous innoculation.  Pre-op angiogram showed no significant CAD.  On 4/5/89 she underwent composite aortic root replacement with a 20mm life net aortic homograft by Dr. Jerome.  Due to heavily calcified RCA ostium, a button for re-implantation couldn't be created so she recieved a single vessel SVG to prox RCA.  Post op course was complicated by afib with high grade AV block for which she recieved a dual chamber PPM.  She was discharged to rehab with a PICC to complete a course of IV PCN.  However, she was re-admitted in early May while still at rehab with an episode of chest pain at rest.  ECG was paced but biomarkers were mildly positive (troponin ~0.5).  TTE showed the valve was well seated without suggestion of recurrent endocarditis.  There was a new apical WMA.  She underwent cath which showed patent BPG and no significant CAD.  The episode was attributed to embolic phenomenon (? from afib, INR 1.5 on admission).  She was discharged back to rehab and has done well since.



She was seen in the ID clinic and the PICC line was pulled.  She's back home from rehab now and seems to be fairly well.  She gets fatigued easily and has to rest after walking about a 100 yards.  However, she denies CP, SOB, palpitations, presyncope or focal neurologic deficits.  No F/C or weight loss.  She has a long history of bilateral calf caludication but she isn't exerting herself enough to elicit symptoms.  While at rehab, she was sleeping on 4 pillows and would develop orthopnea if sleeping flat.  Now she's sleeping on 2 pillows for comfort and doesn't seem to have anymore orthopnea.  However, she does experience what sounds like PND a couple of times per week.  She denies LE edema.  She's tolerating all medications well.  Home BS checks have been running 90-130.

	EKG:

   A-V sequentially paced at 70



	Impression:

   Overall, Ms. Kong seems to be recovering quite well after a difficult couple of months.  Her exercise tolerance is fairly poor, likely reflecting deconditioning.  To that end, I've referred her to the cardiac rehab program at Glenbeigh Hospital (closer to home).



She has occasional episodes of possible PND but no other evidence of volume overload on exam.  If her symptoms persist, I've asked her to notify me and we'll try a low dose of lasix.



In terms of rhythm issues, she is now completely paced.  She probably doesn't need amio anymore so we'll stop it today.  In terms of coumadin, it's probably reasonable to continue for 3 months following valve replacement.  She's due to see Dr. Jerome next month; we'll defer to him in terms of the duration of post-op anti-coagulation from a bioprosthetic valve perspective.  With regard to Afib, she had post-op Afib but now she's atrially paced.  If future PPM interogations don't reveal underlying Afib, she may not need coumadin in the long run.



She'll return to clinic in 6 months or sooner prn.  Seen with Dr. Richard Oden.

Dear Ms. Gustafson, 


I have just received your test results and I would like to share them with you.



Your Hemoglobin A1c value was 7.30 on 01/29/2123. It has remained stable compared to the last value of 7.10 on 10/29/2122. Hemoglobin A1c is a blood test that indicates how well you have controlled your blood sugar over the past 3 months. We would like to keep it below 7.


I suggest a trial of metformin 500mg twice daily
test your sugars to keep below 140 2 hours after meals

If you have any questions about these results, please do not hesitate to contact me.

REASON FOR VISIT:  Followup for diabetic cheiropathy.  Rule out other diabetes-related musculoskeletal syndrome.  Monitoring of Ultracet therapy and left shoulder injection.  

 

INTERVAL HISTORY:  Left shoulder injection was helpful but only last short time.  Just  a week or so.  Ultracet was relieving pains but was not able to afford it.  Feels stable and not worse since last seen.  Telling me he is cutting down his medications and he is letting his doctors know about this. No acute swelling or further different joint complaints other than what was described in my previous notes.  Rest of review of systems again unchanged.   



MEDICATIONS:  The medication file is same as last time, except for addition of Tylenols now.  

 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: BP 100/70.  Other VS WNL. Wt. 170lb.  Gait:  Slow.  Cooperative.  VSS.  HEENT:  Halitosis.  Poor teeth hygiene.  Lungs:  Clear.  Heart:  Unremarkable.  Abdomen exam:  Slight sensitiveness in epigastrium.  A little low-frequency tremor in extremities.  Musculoskeletal examination:  Both shoulders with limited ROM.  Left shoulder active ROM is improved compared to the last description.  Hands with prayer's sign present.  Elbows again show lesser degree of flexion contracture.  Range of motion in both shoulders diminished, 

more in the left side.  Hardening of skin on the palm side of hands.  Has atrophy of intrinsic muscles of hands.  The rest of joint examination, free of inflammation.  Unchanged from last description.  

 

IMPRESSION:  Diabetic cheiropathy.  Rule out other diabetes-related musculoskeletal syndrome esp in shoulders.  Helped by Ultracet.  Osteoarthritis changes of early stage.  Status post olecranon bursitis.  Elevated creatinine.  

 

PLANS:  

1.  Continue Ultracet up 2 tablets prn once     twice a day; Samples given.

2.  May consider low-dose narcotics, given his multiple comorbidity and sensitive renal function to nonsteroidal therapy.  3.  Close followup for diabetes care with other physicians.

	Note: There is an addendum for this note (6/10/2097)
		


	Reason for visit:
   Mr. Bell is an 81 year old male with recent CABG, now admitted via EW with progressive shortness of breath and hypoxia for further evaluation.


	Interval History:
   He has multiple cardiac risk factors and a history of CAD dating back to April 2097. At that point, he noted increasing chest pressure and dyspnea on minimal exertion. Following a positive stress test, he was admitted for cardiac catheterization. Coronary angiography revealed severe multi vessel CAD. He had an IABP placed and underwent cardiac surgical evaluation. Carotid non-invasive studies revealed a moderate right carotid lesion with mild left carotid disease. 

He underwent a 4 vessel CABG by Dr. Troyer. His graft anatomy includes a LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the PDA and PLV and a SVG to the OM branch. He required re-exploration for bleeding. He also had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, treated with Amiodarone. His IABP was removed a few days post operatively. He developed new anterior ST changes, and an echocardiogram revealed a marked decline in his LV function from 66% to 19%. 

He was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab. Coronary angiography revealed a widely patent SVG to OM, a 30% ostial lesion in the SVG to the PDA and PLV. The LIMA was patent, but there was no flow into the distal LAD. He underwent stenting of the LIMA anastomosis into the LAD with a 2.5mm x 18mm, 2.5mm x 12mm and 2.5mm x 12mm MiniVision stents. 

His post cardiac surgical course was further complicated by a Serratia pneumonia and a transient worsening renal function. He also required sternal rewiring for sternal instability. He was followed by Dr. Hardin. His HIT assay was borderline negative. He was also found to have a factor VII deficiency, and was treated with argatroban. Lower extremity non-invasive studies revealed a R posterior tibial DVT, and he was discharged on Fopndaparinux. A follow up echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 31% with apical akinesis, with only mild mitral regurgitation. He was discharged to rehab on post operative day 20. 

He was discharged from rehab on June 5th. On June 7th he was lightheaded and found to be hypotensive by the VNA. His systolic pressures were 78 to 90 mmHg, and his lisinopril was decreased and his Lasix dose was cut in half. He denies any chest discomfort, throat or arm discomfort or palpitations. He denies any PND, but has been sleeping in a hospital bed with the head elevated 45 degrees. The family updated the office earlier this morning - 2 pound weight gain and shortness of breath. His Lasix was increased to 40 mg bid. However, when seen by VNA, his room air saturation was 76%. 911 was called and he was brought to WGCC ED for evaluation. 



	Past medical history:

	Assessment and plan:
   CM/CAD - with recent CABG and coronary stenting, now admitted via the EW with dyspnea and hypoxia. Initial cardiac enzyme screen is negative, but BNP markedly elevated. Based on exam, suspect a combination of CHF and pleural effusions (diuretic medication was not being taken at prescribed dose accidentally). Will admit for diuresis, if significant effusion not improving with diuretics, may need thoracentesis. If BP allows, will resume low dose ACEI tomorrow. Check echocardiogram to assess EF and pericardial effusion. continue aspirin and Plavix. 

Recent DVT - on Fondaparinux - please continue and ask Dr. Hardin to see while in-patient (known to him). 

DM - continue current regimen, follow and cover as needed.

RIVERS,KARSTEN   957-18-08-4                    VISIT DATE: 02/07/66

The patient was seen and examined by me.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 39-year-old man with a 

history of hypertension and diabetes, whose social history is 

unremarkable, who has a negative review of systems, and who has no 

history of any surgical procedures.  He presents with a burn on the 

right side of the neck.  He presents to the emergency department 

with a minor amount of redness on the right side of the neck and 

minor soft tissue swelling.  The trachea is midline.  The uvula is 

midline.  There is no airway compromise.  There are no airway 

complaints.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  No voice change.  The airway is patent and 

intact.  The lungs are clear, with no wheezes.  The examination 

shows a first-degree burn of the right side of the neck, with no 

blistering and no breakage of the skin.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient received a tetanus shot 

and was seen by the Burn Service.  He was dressed with Bacitracin 

and discharged home.  He was to follow up in 48 hours just for a 

recheck.  The Burn Service essentially signed off on him, with no 

need for follow-up, but given this was his neck and only 

first-degree, I asked him to return here for follow-up.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  First-degree burn of the right side of the neck.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  He is discharged 

with Bacitracin ointment and analgesics, and is to follow up in 48 

hours.  The patient's condition on discharge is stable.

                                              8-23-76
 
 
 
HPI: Mrs. William-Nuel is a 61-year old patient of mine who carries a 
diagnosis of essential hypertension and comes in today for a routine 
checkup. Patient appears to be doing fine. She has been compliant with her 
antihypertensive regimen, which consists of nifedipine and also 
hydrochlorothiazide. Since our last meeting, the patient has lost 
approximately 15 to 20 pounds. She has been exercising on a daily basis 
and eating very well, both of which have had very, very significant and 
beneficial results on her blood pressure and pressure today on examination 
was 120/80 in both arms. The patient was complaining of some ankle 
swelling, and in looking through her medicines I noted that she had been 
on furosemide, which was a holdover from the time of her most recent 
admission. I quickly switched to furosemide to hydrochlorothiazide, which 
I feel would give her much better diuretic response and relief of her 
symptoms over the next few days. 
 
The final issue with the patient today is low back pain, which she has had 
chronically for the last several years after suffering a fall in 2065. We 
have tried a whole host of conservative measures, which have included bed 
rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and back exercises. The 
patient is referred now to the Paoli Memorial Hospital Spinal Clinic for 
services to obtain further help, and hopefully treatment, of her pain. 
Treatment recommendations from the Spinal Clinic will be forthcoming. 
Patient is scheduled to follow up with me again in two to three months.
 
ADDENDUM: The issue of her annual screening was addressed also and patient 
agreed to have her cholesterol checked today, but does not want to have 
either a mammogram or a Pap smear. She complains that she does not have 
faith in these procedures and that this is something that she is not used 
to and does not want to have done. I attempted to discuss the need and why 
it is necessary to undergo continued screening and will continue to do 
this with the patient in the future, but for now, the patient adamantly 
refuses either of the two examinations.

RE:  Kenneth Umstead
     MR #401-10-87-8
 
Dear Jac:
 
I saw your patient, Kenneth Umstead, in the Cardiology Office today
and he seems like he is improved. He feels his legs are better and
that he can walk greater distances. He feels very comfortable. 
 
His current medications include Metoprolol 50 mg per day,
Nifedipine XL 60 mg per day, Lasix 20 mg per day. 
 
On exam today, he has a blood pressure of 146/76, a heart rate of
65 and regular. Weight 210 pounds. Head and neck unremarkable.
Chest is clear. Cardiac exam is notable for an S4 and a I/VI
systolic ejection murmur. The rest of his exam was unremarkable.
 
Resting 12 lead electrocardiogram is unchanged demonstrating normal
sinus rhythm and a left axis deviation. There is a nonspecific
intraventricular conduction delay. 
 
I think Mr. Umstead is doing very well. He would like to have his
arterial pulses rechecked noninvasively and I tried to arrange that
schedule. In addition, his Metoprolol has been only once a day and
if he can tolerate it twice a day he will have a better control and
more prolonged risk prevention. I suggest that we increase it to 50
mg bid. I also told him how to take his pulse and he can keep an
eye on it. If it drops too low we can reduce the dose. He asked
that I see him again in about six months for routine re-evaluation
and I will be happy to do so. If any problems develop in the
interim please do not hesitate to contact me. 
 
Thank you for allowing me to help with his care. 
 
Kindest regards.

RE: Lloyd Gregg 

    MR#65772757

 

Dear Xzavior, 

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Lloyd Gregg for follow

up of his emphysema.

 

The patient reports that he continues to lead a very

active lifestyle working as a sales representative roughly 10 hours

a day, frequently lifting 60 pound boxes.  When he

returns home from work he cooks dinner and this

combined with his work schedule and picking up his

daughter from school and walking the dog has prohibited

him from a regular exercise program.  Needless to say,

he has remained active.  He is not limited in these

activities by his respiratory function with the

exception of some periodic exacerbation of dyspnea with

heavy lifting.  He uses albuterol during these

instances anywhere between 0 and 2 to 3 times per day. 

His usual peak expiratory flow rate is roughly 300-350

liters per minute.  He knows that when his PEFR falls

to below 250 for 3 days in a row to contact you for

advice as well as burst of prednisone and he has had 1

burst of prednisone since our last visit in April.

 

His medical regimen is notable for Flovent 220

micrograms per puffs, 2 puffs twice a day, Serevent MDI

2 puffs twice a day, Allopurinol, colchicine, Vasotec

and the albuterol as mentioned above. 

 

RE: Lloyd Gregg            -2-  November 29,2083 

    MR#65772757

 

The patient's review of systems is notable for the absence of

fevers, chills, sweats, chest discomfort, symptoms of GERD,

change in his bowel or bladder habits or weight.  He does

continue to have nearly continuous post nasal drip which leads to

frequent clearing of his throat and occasional cough.  There is

no hemoptysis or significant sputum production.

 

On physical exam, he appears well, is in no respiratory distress. 

NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI, AS, pink conjunctiva.  TM's are clear with

normal light reflexes bilaterally.  His nasal mucosa is notable

for mild erythema bilaterally with a clear nasal discharge.  No

significant LAN in the cervical or supraclavicular axillary

chains.  Chest exam reveals an increased AP diameter and

prolongation of his expiratory phase.  He has an occasional

expiratory wheeze.  There are no focal findings of consolidation

and air movement is moderate.  No significant JVD and he has a

regular rate and rhythm with an S4, S1, a normally split S2 and

there are no murmurs, rubs or S3.  Abdomen is benign without HSM,

focal tenderness or masses.  His extremities are without

clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  His weight is 223 pounds. 

Temperature 97.1 degrees, pulse 86 per minute, BP 142/82 and his

respiratory rate is 20 with a room air resting oxygen saturation

of 97 percent.

 

My impression is that the patient's severe airflow obstruction

secondary to emphysema is stable on his current medical regimen. 

I once again encouraged him to continue to lead robust and active

life.  We agreed that the current action plan for a burst of

prednisone is appropriate and I also have provided him my contact

information in the event that he cannot reach you in the midst of

a flare.  I have refilled all of his current prescriptions.  To

try and prevent him from requiring these frequent bursts of

prednisone through the winter months, we have also begun

Combivent 2 puffs 4 times a day as well as Nasonex nasal spray to

be used 2 puffs in each nostril once a day.  We talked about

vaccinations and he reported that he has recently received the

influenza vaccine and he has previously received the pneumonia

vaccine.

 

Thank you for allowing me to participate in Mr. Gregg's care. 

He will follow up with us on a routine basis in 6 month's time

but will contact us sooner should he develop more symptoms of a

flare of his COPD.

STUDIES:
Plain Films:
     FINDINGS:
     Right hip: There is a transverse transcervical fracture through
     the sphenoid.  There is lateral superior displacement of the
     distal segment.  There is no evidence of dislocation.
     
     Pelvis: There is diffuse osteopenia involving the pelvis.  Again
     noted is a transcervical fracture to the right femur.  There is
     superior lateral displacement of the distal fracture segment.  The
     sacrum is not well seen secondary to overlying bowel gas.  Minimal
     degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are noted.
     
     Shoulder: There is no evidence of left shoulder dislocation or
     acute fracture.  The visualized lung fields and ribs are intact.
     There is minimal degenerative change involving the left a.c.
     joint.
     
     Chest: Comparison to 10/31/97.  Multiple pulmonary nodules are
     noted.  There is no evidence of focal consolidation or pulmonary
     edema.  No large pleural effusion or appreciable pneumothorax is
     identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
     Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Right transcervical femoral fracture.  No evidence of dislocation.
     
     No evidence of shoulder dislocation.
     
     Multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with metastatic disease.
     
     FINDINGS:
     Previously noted minimally displaced right hip fracture.
     Osteoarthrosis of the knee. Soft tissues swelling along the medial
     aspect of the knee is noted.  There are vascular calcifications.
     Generalized osteopenia.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Right hip fracture as previously described.  Osteoarthrosis of the
     knee. 
       
EKG: Sinus bradycardia.


ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN:


87yo F with h/o metastatic pancreatic CA s/p 1 dose of gemcitabine and biliary stenting, CKD, DM, and HTN who p/w right hip fracture s/p mechanical fall at home. The plan of care by issue is as follows:


(1)     Right hip fracture: Patient will require post-operative anti-coagulation. Patient is undergoing high-risk procedure and is also at increased risk for VTE given cancer dx. According to guidelines from ACCP:


#UFH 5000 Units SC TID [or LMWH &gt;3400 Units SC QD (her CrCl &lt;30, therefore renally dosed = LMWH 30mg SC QD)] to be started either in PACU or on the floor.
#Compression stockings
#Pneumo-boots
#Plan to continue VTE prophylaxis for 4-6 weeks post-op
#Encourage ambulation as soon as tolerated (per ortho, pt might be ambulatory as soon as tomorrow)


(2)     DM
Patient recently started on insulin at home. Will continue half dose of home insulin with IVF with glucose.
#RISS, until tolerating POs, then restart normal insulin.


(3)     Dispo
Plan to D/C when clinically stable post-op. Per PCP, patient would like to return directly home after surgery without rehab (home rehab). Family notes that patient currently lives at daughter&#8217;s home where there are many steps which would make home rehab difficult.


#Consider rehab placement, follow-up attending recs, discuss with family in AM

			CARDIOLOGY

			

			HAWTHORNE STATE HOSPITAL

			



Dear Dr.  Morgan:



  Thank you very much for your referral of Gabrielle Oreilly for evaluation of coronary artery disease and a right coronary artery aneurysm as documented on CT scanning.  She is a 77-year-old woman with longstanding history of tobacco use of greater than 100-pack years quitting approximately eight years ago. She suffers from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, and what appears to be a recent diagnosis of COPD. She has always been very limited in her activity suffering from back pain, and has never been in any type of regular exercise routine. She recently has noticed dyspnea on exertion over the past two to three months and has been treated with several prednisone tapers as well as an albuterol nebulizer at home and an albuterol inhaler. With these treatments, her dyspnea improved, but would worsen as the steroids were tapered.  She does report some episodes of chest heaviness, which she describes as a heavy feeling in her chest, which will last for minutes at a time. These are not exertionally related and are occurring approximately once per week. She was placed on Nexium with some improvement, but does feel as if she will still develop these episodes. 



To further evaluate her symptoms of persistent cough and shortness of breath, she underwent a CT scan to evaluate for pulmonary embolus. This was performed on 05/20/2101 and did not show any evidence of PE, however, there was coronary artery calcification with plaque noted in the left main coronary artery. There was a focal 9 mm aneurysm of the right coronary artery. She was then referred to me for further evaluation.



			Past medical history:

   Hypertension. 

Hyperlipidemia. 

Glucose intolerance. 

Left bundle branch block. 

Diverticular bleed. 

Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 

Hypothyroidism. 

COPD.



Current Medications:

 prednisone taper

hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg qd

potassium chloride 10 mEq qd

lisinopril 30 mg qd

aspirin 81 mg qd

calcium supplement 600 mg qd

levothyroxine 25 mcg qd

Lipitor 10 mg qd

Celexa 40 mg qd

albuterol inhaler; Dir: and nebulizer

multivitamins



Allergies:

			

Allergy   She reports receiving Halothane gas remotely with the development of jaundice at the time of her hysterectomy.

Drug allergy   Halothane gas, which caused hepatitis per her report.



			Family history:

   Notable for her father with myocardial infarction at 54.  Mother with ""an enlarged heart,"" who died at 82.



			Social history:

   She quit smoking eight years ago, previously smoked two packs per day for 35 years.  She lives alone but her daughter lives above her in the same building.



			Review of systems:

   She denies any significant change in weight.  She has intermittent headaches relieved with Advil.  She reports chronic cough and wheeze, which has been improved on prednisone.  She has shortness of breath with exertion but denies exertional chest pain.  No lower extremity edema, palpitations, or dizzy spells.  She reports her reflux symptoms are improved on her Nexium.  She has no history of stroke, no history of anemia.  She reports her sugars have been diet controlled.  Otherwise extended review of systems was negative.



Physical examination:

			

-Pulse:   70

-BP: 142/70  

-General:   She is an elderly woman in no distress and comfortable at rest

-Skin:   Free of rashes

-Heent:   benign

-Neck:   JVP was at 5.  She had 2+ carotids without bruits

-Chest:   Lungs are clear without significant wheeze

-Cardiac:   Regular, S1 and S2 without murmurs

-Abdomen:   Soft with a nontender reducible ventral hernia

-Extremities:   She had no edema in her extremities with 2+ distal pulses

-Neuro:   She is alert and oriented

-weight:   185 pounds



			EKG:

    demonstrated sinus rhythm at 70 with a left bundle branch block.



			Assessment and plan:

   Gabrielle Oreilly has multiple risk factors for coronary disease including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, a positive family history, and heavy tobacco use in the past. She presently has had recurrent bouts of a COPD flare, which has been responsive to prednisone and albuterol nebulizer therapy. Her chest CT scan demonstrates plaque in the left main coronary artery as well as a right coronary artery aneurysm. I do believe she needs further evaluation first by functional study, and I will arrange an adenosine stress test and consider cardiac catheterization to further define her anatomy with her multiple high-risk features and abnormalities as seen on her recent CT scan. She will continue a slow taper with possible addition of other inhalers to control her COPD.



Plan: 

1. Adenosine MIBI to evaluate for ischemia in distributions of the left system as well as the RCA aneurismal segment. 

2. Treatment of her emphysema as per your office. 

3. I will see her again in follow up in one month and consider cardiac catheterization for further evaluation. 

4. I have instructed her to proceed to the emergency room with the development of any significant chest pain or progressive shortness of breath.

BARTON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL



History of present illness

			

  This was a followup visit for this 28-year-old black man with the medical problems of type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, thrombocytosis, and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient states that since I last saw him, he is being evaluated further for renal transplant. In addition, attempts were made to place an AV fistula for dialysis in his right arm and this did not work out. Given that this one did not work out, a decision was made to wait to see if there was a transplant candidate for him to get a renal transplant rather than put all of the pieces in place for hemodialysis if in fact he would need it. Most recently, the patient's creatinine was 6.4 and his BUN was 46 two weeks ago.



Major Problems





Diabetes mellitus

Type 1 diabetes mellitus.  The patient's diabetes is currently well controlled on his current regimen of NPH and Regular Insulin.  Most recently, his hemoglobin A1c was 6.6 on 02/27/2062.  The patient states that all of his fingersticks at home have been consistently between 70 and 110.



Chronic renal insufficiency

The patient is being evaluated for renal transplant and possible candidate that his family members and friends will be tested to see whether there are a match shortly.



Hypertension

The patient is on a tremendous amount of medication to treat his hypertension. Currently, he is on labetalol 600 mg PO BID, furosemide 20 mg PO QD, clonidine 0.3 mg PO QHS, lisinopril 40 mg PO QD, and nifedipine XL 90 mg PO QHS. BHypertension is currently well controlled on this regimen.



Erectile dysfunction

The patient was experiencing erectile dysfunction largely on Toprol.  For this reason, the Toprol was discontinued and the patient is having less of a problem with this issue currently.



Anemia

The patient's anemia is due to multiple different factors.  He has recently been started on erythropoietin, which he is getting via injection in the Internal Medicine three times a week.  Most recently, his hematocrit was 29.4% two weeks ago.



Thrombocytosis

The patient is on Hydria 500 mg PO QD for this problem and he is being followed by Hematology.



Hyperlipidemia

The patient's hyperlipidemia is new.  Most recently, his lipids were done on 02/27/2062 and at that time his total cholesterol was 294 and his LDL was 209.  This is a new problem for the patient, given that his lipids were fairly normal six months ago.  Given this, the patient was started on Lipitor 20 mg PO QD for hyperlipidemia.  We will repeat his lipid panel at the time of his next visit in eight weeks.

Hyponatremia



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Ostrander is a 64 yo woman with a hx of schizophrenia, DM2, HTN, HL presenting with confusion and hyponatremia.  Patient states over the past 2 days she has felt confused and weak, citing that when someone would call she was unable to speak.  She also has felt unsteady on her feet and fell twice yesterday when out walking, hitting her face and arm.  She reports dizziness prior to fall but denies chest pain, palpitations or SOB.  There was no loss of consciousness and she was able to get up/ambulate after fall.  Of note, she has switched from drinking 7 cans of diet coke per day to 7 cans of regular coke because the facility where she lives ran out of diet coke.  She is also restricting her caloric intake and her meals consist of a croissant at breakfast, cottage cheese at lunch and an avocado for dinner, in attempt to lose weight.   She has not had any recent medication changes.  She denies recent fever, chills, CP, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria.  She does report significant thirst and frequent urination.  She also reports SOB with exertion, particularly walking up stairs.

EKG &#8211; Sinus tachycardia.  Rate 106.  Q waves in II, III, aVF, V3.  Slightly changed from prior.



                

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ms. Ostrander is a 64 yo Peruvian woman with schizophrenia, HTN, DM2, HL presenting with confusion and found to have significant metabolic disarray including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia and an anion gap.  She also has a mild leukocytosis, anemia &#8211; at baseline, and thrombocytosis.  



##: Hyponatremia &#8211; Calculated serum osmolality is 248 mOsm/L (measured 241) suggesting a hypotonic hyponatremia.  Clinically she appears euvolemic, despite having a dry mouth which may be from patient&#8217;s antipsychotics.   A Uosm of 62 is most suggestive of primary polydipsia vs. low solute.  Patient is drinking 2L coke/day and complaining of excessive thirst, per PCP/psych notes she is told to limit fluids to 1L.  Interestingly this may have been precipitated by switching from diet coke to coke as diet coke contains 30mg Na and 0gm carbs while regular coke contains 45mg Na and 39gm carbohydrates.  Increased carbohydrates with little sodium, protein or potassium load (such as in beer potomania) can inhibit protein breakdown and urea excretion, therefore decreasing daily solute excretion to &lt;250mOsm, which can result in hypoNa if fluid intake is increased.


Correct at a rate of &lt;0.5mEq/L/h since she is no longer symptomatic

Q6H lytes to ensure correct rate of correction &#8211; prevent osmotic demyelination

Fluid restrict to 1L fluid/day

Since she is euvolemic, no indication for NS repletion

Patient refused nutrition consult to discuss dietary choices &#8211; clearly she is making poor dietary choices and her caloric intake is ~800-1000 kcal/day currently from food (+~1000kcal from soda)



##: Protected fall &#8211; History is suggestive of fall in setting of electrolyte distribution and consequential lightheadedness.   Does not seem cardiac in origin, however Q waves in inferior leads appear to have progressed from last EKG on 2/20/67.  Protected fall argues against acute arrhythmic event.


Check orthostatics

Will check cardiac enzymes as EKG is suggestive of progressive Q waves in inferior leads.

Monitor on telemetry.

Physical therapy consult.

Consider repeat outpt colonoscopy to r/o GI malignancy/lesion contributing to anemia



##: Elevated anion gap.  Delta-delta is 8/6=1.3= Pure metabolic acidosis.  Osmolar gap is &lt;10 so ingestion is less likely.  There are no ketones in the UA and there is no evidence of renal failure.  pH is not suggestive of an acidosis.  AG is likely from severe metabolic disarray (decreased anions and cations).

Lisbon, SD  52797                             80910690

Ms. Bird comes in today to follow up on her weight and blood sugar 
control, as well as to discuss her overall mental status and its effects 
on her living situation.
 
PMH:  Her past medical history includes atrial fibrillation, status post 
renal allograft, status post aortic and mitral valve replacements with a 
mechanical valve, on chronic Coumadin, a recent aortic aneurysm repair 
and complications around that, including a cellulitis which has been 
treated, and now waxing and waning mental status.  She also is 
insulin-dependent diabetic.  
 
MEDICATIONS:  Her medications currently include:
1.   Neurontin 300 t.i.d.
2.   Insulin NPH 20 units in the morning, 10 in the evening.
3.   Fosamax each day.
4.   Premarin and Provera.
5.   Tums Extra-Strength.
6.   digoxin 0.25 and 0125.
7.   Mevacor 40 a day.
8.   Coumadin 1mg each day, except Sunday 2mg.
9.   Imuran 100mg a day.
10.  prednisone 20mg every other day.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient notes that she has been feeling well and 
more active.  She is able to walk around her house without her walker.  
She does use the walker outside of the house for safety and precaution.  
She is independent in bathing and washing, as well as cooking and 
preparing meals.  She, however, is requiring a lot of assistance with 
managing her medications.  She has her daughter-in-law downstairs help 
her with this.  She has not been out of the house much in the last 
several months, and, while she wants to drive, no-one has allowed her to 
get behind the wheel.  
 
The patient otherwise feels well with no chest pain, no shortness of 
breath, no change in her bowel or bladder.
 
HABITS:  She has had a weight which has been stable, and her appetite 
has been good.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Notable for a well-appearing female who walks 
with a walker, slowly, but in no acute distress.  Her weight is 104 lbs.  
Her blood pressure today is 130/72.  Her pulse is 80 and regular today.  
She has no peripheral edema, and she is comfortable sitting in a chair.
 
IMPRESSION:  My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is stable with 
her current regimen and medications.  We have been manipulating her

Coumadin to keep her INR between 2 and 3.5 and, most recently, it was 
2.5, earlier this week.  She will continue on her current medications, 
as noted above.  
 
The bulk of the discussion was regarding her home situation and her 
mental status.  She has clearly improved her mental status gradually 
over the last several months.  She is anxious to drive.  However, 
everyone in the family who is with her at the visit and her visiting 
nurse agree that she is not mentally sound enough to be behind a wheel.  
I explained this in no uncertain terms, and also set a milestone in 
management of her own medications.  Hence, our three goals that we set 
today were:
1.   Management of the patient's own medications, which she was doing 
     six months ago.
2.   To get out of the house at least once a week, using either 
     community transportation or a family member.
3.   To be doing the family's laundry each week.
 
While the patient was not happy about being told that she could not 
drive, she understood the reasons and was satisfied with the goals that 
we set.
 
Hence, I will see her back in about six weeks and see how she is doing 
with these goals.  As well, we will continue to have the visiting nurse 
see her every other week to monitor her blood sugar and Coumadin.

27 Caroll St, #734 
Bluefield, ME 12111 

Dear Dr. Easterling: 

We had the pleasure of seeing Brian Martin in the Cardiology Service for follow up of rapid heart action. At his last visit we gave him a 30-day loop event recorder for arrhythmia surveillance due to palpitations. Since that point he has transmitted events showing rapid atrial fibrillation up to 160 Bpm associated with chest discomfort, jaw pain and chest thumping. These episodes occur on a random basis and last up to 45 minutes. He does not identify any precipitating factors and symptoms resolve spontaneously. He denies dyspnea, PND, orthopnea, lightheadedness, pre syncope or syncope. He reportedly has had a negative stress test and echocardiogram. He is not on any medications. He has never been on Coumadin. 


	Past medical history:
   1. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation 
2. Nonalcoholic steatotic hepatitis 
3. Palpitations 
4. Rotator cuff surgery in 2071

	Family history:
   Mother died at age 62 of a heart attack. He has four siblings, all in good health. 


	Social history:
   He is married with two sons, age 21 and 18, both of whom are in good health. He works as an Revenue Officer for Springfield Armory Inc in Picture Rocks, Maine. 

Habits: He has never used street drugs. He does not smoke tobacco. He drinks 6 beers/alcohol per week and 2 cups of coffee per day.


	Review of systems:
   Negative in detail as detailed on his questionnaire and confirmed during the office visit.

	Assessment and plan:
   Mr. Martin is a 52-year-old male with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. We have discussed the physiology of the electrical conduction system and the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation. We have discussed treatment options including rate control, rhythm control or pulmonary vein isolation. We have scheduled him for nuclear stress test to R/O ischemia given his symptoms of chest discomfort and new onset of atrial fibrillation and will send him for echocardiogram to R/O structural heart disease. 

We have had a long discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and if his diagnostic testing is within normal limits he would like to possibly consider this as an option for treatment. We have started him on Toprol XL 50 mg daily. If his diagnostic testing is within normal limits we will proceed initially with starting Class IC antiarrhythmic for the treatment of his atrial fibrillation. We will continue a discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and continue medical management. He has a CHAD2 Score of 0. We will therefore recommend treating with Aspirin 325 mg daily for prophylactic embolic protection and would not recommend coumadin at this time. 

We will complete diagnostic testing, follow up with the results and then proceed. We have encouraged him to call with any questions, concerns, or changes in health status. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions in regard to his care.

We are consulted by Dr. Bonilla for assistance with glycemic management.



Mr. Ervin is a 67 y/o gentleman who is presently POD # 1 after AVR and 2V CABG.  He had known calcific AS and presented with increasing fatigue and dyspnea on exertion.  He was subsequently found to have worsening AS and CAD, including LM disease.  His peri-operative course has been notable for hyperglycemia with maximum BG 252.  He was started on an insulin  infusion according to the Portland Protocol and remains on 0.5-2 units/hour since midnight with BS 117-134-163-151-125-137-98-99.



Mr. Ervin recalls having been diagnosed with DM at the age of 19 as part of a military physical.  He was overweight and was placed on dietary therapy.  Per his own report his DM was diet controlled and ""seemed to disappear"" several years after initial diagnosis.  Approximately 4 years ago he experienced blurry vision and was again noted to have elevated BGs (he is uncertain of the magnitude of the BG elevation).  He resumed dietary therapy and has achieved good control with a  pre-op A1c of 6.2.  He is followed at the Skiff.  He has never been on insulin or OHAs and denies knowledge of diabetic complications.  He checks BS at home sporadically which are usually in the low-mid 100s.  He says when he experiences hyperglycemic symptoms (i.e. occasional nocturia) he walks to bring down his blood sugar.  In general he is active, walking several miles/day.



Past Medical History: HTN, AS, DM2 as above



Current Medications: Insulin, K/Mg, ASA, Toradol, Zofran, Vanco, Carafate



Social History: remote tobacco, ETOH



Famiy History: Son with DM1,  Grandmother with DM



ROS: Denies HA or changes in vision.  +SOB PTA.  No abdominal pain or changes in bowels.  No dysuria, occasional nocturia.  No recent lower extremity swelling.  Remainder of review of systems is negative or as per HPI.



Physical Exam:



Vitals: 98.2 70 120/68

Gen: pleasant, heavy set (but muscular) gentleman in NAD

HEENT: NC/AT EOMI

Neck: supple central venous line in place

CV: distant HS

Chest: wound intact

Lungs: Clear anteriorly

Abd: S/NT

Extremities: no edema, well perfused

Neuro: A&Ox3

Skin: intact



Labs: pre-op A1c 6.2.  Prior A1c 7.2 in 4/73



A/P 

Mr. Ervin has DM2 which was adequately controlled pre-operatively with diet and exercise.  He is presently requiring insulin in the setting of the stress of surgery.  Meticulous BG control is important in the post-operative period.  The goal is to maintain BS<175.  He should remain on the Portland Protocol until at least POD #3.  At that point only if he is fully stabilized and eating well can he be transitioned on to an alternative regimen.  He may transiently require subcutaneous insulin but will ideally be able to resume dietary control of DM.



Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient. Our team will follow with you.

 Attending Note


I performed a history and neurological examination of the patient and discussed his management with the resident.  I reviewed the resident's note and agree with his documented findings and plan of care.


The patient is a 71 year old man with HTN, DM and high cholesterol, PPM on coumadin for AF, glaucoma, who presented 4 w/a with R facial droop and dysarthria lasting &lt; 1 minute.  Was admitted for TIA w/u and CT scan was negative.  CTA was also normal.  He had had a similar episode in the UK in the past. Was started on a statin and ASA and discharged.  His wife feels he may not be that compliant but his INR was 2.3 today.  It had been 2 when he came in with the TIA&gt;


The exam today showed:
Acuity was 20/70 OD and Hand motions OS.
Left APD
Fundi with large C/D OD and diffuse pallor OS with an opticociliary shunt vessel along the nasal disc.
Right facial weakness in the sense of eyebrow drop and less wrinkles in the forehead but smile equal.  Was not in UMN fashion.
Motor, sensory, gait otherwise normal.


Assessment:  
Status post TIA possibly related to AF

Left optic neuropathy with signs of chronic compression or ischemia.  The latter is more likely cause (especially since I did not see any mass lesion compressing the L optic nerve on the CT) and is proably secondary to glaucoma.


Plan:
Reviewed coumadin food rules with him.
Continue 
ASA and coumadin and statin
Continued HTN and DM control
Will touch base with ophthalmology regarding the left optic neuropathy

Return in 6 months.

                             OFFICE NOTE
 
Address:  26 Burrit St, Marlborough, WI 21145
 
First visit for this 51-year-old white male.
 
1.  Gout.  This has been present for 7 years.  Evaluated at Mary by
Dr. Farrar.  Treated with Colchicine.  He cut down the amount of
organ meats and red meat that he had been eating at the time.  He has
not had any alcohol for 11 years.  Strong family history in his father
and all his brothers.  Continues to have 4 or 5 relatively mild flares
a year which are frequently attributable to forgetting to take the
Colchicine.
 
PMH:  Tonsillectomy.  Cervical radiculitis.  He is a recovering
alcoholic.  No alcohol for 11 years.  Hypertension when he was
drinking.  Hidradenitis.  
 
Meds:  Colchicine 0.6 mg q.d.  
 
ALL:  None.
 
FH:  Father died at 57 from an MI.  Mother at 60 in her sleep. 
Brothers have gout, one has hypertension.
 
SH:  Married for the second time.  His wife is Emily Ippolito another
patient of mine.  They will have been married for one year in May. 
He works as a Patternmaker for McCall in Enid.  He averages 1 1/2
packs of cigarettes a day for the last 35 years.  No alcohol.  No drugs
or HIV exposure.
 
ROS:  Bifocals. Slightly decreased hearing in the left ear.  No chest
pain.  Has a chronic AM cough bringing up 1/4 cup of phlegm daily.  He
occasionally plays tennis and bicycles.  He believes his cholesterol
was 170.  Does like high cholesterol food but has cut back because his
wife has a problem.  He uses seat belts.
 
On physical examination he is a very pleasant large white male.  His
weight is 222 lbs., blood pressure 128/88, heart rate 72.  HEENT -
EOMI, PERL, fundi negative.  Cerumen impacted against the TM's.  Benign
oral cavity examination.  No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Lungs
clear.  No murmurs or gallops.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No testicular
masses or hernias.  Normal prostate, guaiac negative stool.   Absent
distal pulses.  2+ femoral pulses without any bruits.  1+ reflexes.  No
swelling or tenderness over the first MTP's.  Neurologic exam shows
hearing decreased to watch tick bilaterally.  Air conduction is greater
than bone.  Weber is not lateralized.  
 
Impressions and plans:  1.  Gout.  It sounds like this is really not
much of a problem when he remembers to take the Colchicine.  I
encouraged him to make this a regular habit.  We will check a random
uric acid level.
 
2.  Cardiac risk factors.  He is a male with a very positive family
history who is a smoker.  He has significant cardiac risk factors.  We
spent a long time talking about smoking today.  At his request I gave
him a prescription for Nicoderm patches.  He will start at 21 mg for
six weeks and then move to 14 mg for 2 weeks and 7 mg for 2 weeks.  We
will check a cholesterol and he should be less than 200 given his risk
factors.  I pointed out to him his evidence by history of chronic
bronchitis and of peripheral vascular disease.  I think he found this
sobering.
 
3.  General health.  We discussed exercise, cholesterol and seat belts.
We also discussed the use of Q-Tips which I think may also be a
significant contributing factor to his decreased hearing and the
impaction of cerumen.  I recommended ear drops.  We can have him tested
formally when he becomes interested in intervention.

RE:  Christine Olivier
     MR #652-33-21-5
 
Dear Dr. Arteaga:
 
Mrs. Olivier returns for routine follow-up.  Currently, she
complains of mild exertional fatigue and rare exertional chest
discomfort.  In addition, she states that she has no energy and
worries that her coronary artery pathology has returned.  She
reports occasionally taking sublingual nitroglycerin for chest
discomfort but this is on an infrequent basis.  
 
She remains on a plethora of medications including NPH insulin 64
units sub q qAM along with 34 units CZI sub q qAM and 68 units NPH
sub q qPM, enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d., Captopril 25 mg
po t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg po b.i.d., simvastatin 10 mg po q.d.,
amlodipine 5 mg po q.d., Neurontin 900 mg po t.i.d., atenolol 50 mg
po q.d., estrogen 0.05 topically q three days and a nitropatch .2
mg per twenty-four hours which she wears for twelve over 
twenty-four hour period.
 
Physical exam reveals a well-nourished woman in no acute distress. 
Blood pressure right arm sitting 140/80, heart rate 85 and regular,
respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 174 pounds.  The neck is
supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2+ without significant bruits. 
Chest is completely clear.  Cardiac exam shows a normal S1,
physiologically split S2 and a I-II/VI systolic ejection murmur
radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic
murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities without
appreciable edema.  Peripheral pulses are intact.
 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85.  PR interval
of .14, QRS .08, QT .32, axis -20 degrees.  There are mild diffuse
nonspecific ST-T wave changes as well as evidence for left
ventricular hypertrophy.  Compared to her last electrocardiogram,
her heart rate is slower and her ST-T wave changes are less
prominent.
 
 
Olivier, Christine
MR #652-33-21-5               -2-            December 05, 2074
 
Impression:  Mrs. Olivier has currently recovered from her 
multi-lesion PTCA and stent placement therapy.  Currently it is not
clear to me that her symptoms are secondary to recurrent ischemia,
however I will have her undergo an exercise tolerance test
(adenosine MIBI) to help to further evaluate this.  In addition, I
will obtain routine blood studies including an glycosylated
hemoglobin.  It is certainly possible that her fatigue and
generalized sense of lack of energy is from a non-cardiac cause. 
Pending review of these lab studies however, I have not altered her
present regimen.  She will contact you or myself should her chest
pain syndrome at all progress in terms of severity or duration.  
 
Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.
 
Sincerely yours,

RIVERS, KARSTEN
95718084
10/26/2073


To Whom It May Concern:

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Karsten Rivers in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Kimball County Manor for initial evaluation and management.  As you may know, he is a 47-year-old gentleman with a history of poorly controlled hypertension, poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, former tobacco use, morbid obesity, no family history of early coronary disease and no known coronary disease.  He was presented to the Cardiovascular Clinic today for preoperative evaluation prior to an orthopedic surgery scheduled for later on this week by Dr. Phillip Isaac Crosby, at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation Center.  This gentleman has a torn ligament in his right hip and is scheduled for laparoscopic repair at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation.  Mr. Rivers, as mentioned, denies any history of known coronary artery disease.  He has had a prior stress test greater than 15 years ago, but none recently.  He denies any recent catheterization or echocardiogram.  He works currently as a floor coverer in Shelton and has done so for 20 years.  He is able to ambulate approximately two flights of steps, but at the top of the steps develops slight dyspnea on exertion, unclear whether or not this is related to a cardiac etiology or secondary to his morbid obesity with his weight over 400 pounds.  He denies any heart failure symptoms, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema or nocturia though he has been maintained on Lasix diuresis in the past though none currently.  Additionally, he has poorly controlled diabetes for which he is being followed in the Diabetes Clinic here at the KCM as well as poorly controlled hypertension for which he is on multiple agents.  He denies any history of exertional chest discomfort and as mentioned, he is still quite active despite his BLANK as an Interior Designs floor coverer.

Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.

Past medical history is remarkable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity.

Medications include Toprol-XL 125 mg p.o. daily, aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily, Lipitor 20 mg p.o. daily, Neurontin 400 mg p.o. daily, insulin, Aldactone 25 mg p.o. daily, Avapro 300 mg p.o. daily and minoxidil 10 mg p.o. daily.

He is allergic to penicillin for which he develops a rash.

His social history is remarkable for former tobacco use for many years, though he quit more than three years ago.  He has no extensive alcohol or illicit drug use history.  He lives locally with his wife and five children and as mentioned is a floor coverer in ID working at Provo.  He is followed by Dr. Gilmore at the Helena Hospital for primary care.

On examination, he is afebrile, heart rate is 98 and regular, blood pressure 148/78 and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute in no acute distress.  He is a well-appearing gentleman in stated age with morbid obesity.  His jugular venous pressure is difficult to estimate given his habitus.  He is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1, S2 and no murmur, rub or gallop.  His abdomen is obese, nontender with positive bowel sounds and no hepatomegalies appreciated.  His extremities are warm and well perfused with trace edema at the ankles.  He has good distal pulsations.  His carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruit.

Laboratory values are not available today.

ECG reveals normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 99.  He has left anterior fascicular hemiblock with normal R wave progression through his precordium.  No evidence for LVH or prior infarction.  He does have low voltage in his limb leads, consistent with his morbid obesity.

Impression:  Mr. Rivers is a very pleasant 47-year-old gentleman with multiple cardiac risk factors, notably insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as well as poorly controlled hypertension with no known coronary artery disease now presenting for cardiovascular clearance prior to elective hip repair scheduled for three days from now.  This gentleman has no known coronary disease and has a reasonable exercise capacity, which I estimate to be 3 to 5 METS.  Most recently, given his hip and orthopedic issues, he has been unable to ambulate even to three METS.  However, prior to his orthopedic injury several months ago, he was able to ambulate up two flights of steps with only minimal dyspnea upon reaching the top step and without any exertional chest discomfort.  However, given his multiple risk factors, notably his poorly controlled diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension as well as former tobacco use, he certainly is at very high risk for obstructive coronary disease.  As such, I recommended we obtain a Persantine PET stress test for tomorrow morning.  If this test is normal without any high risk features or without any evidence for obstructive coronary disease, it would be reasonable for him to proceed with surgery later on this week.  This test will also suffice for his upcoming gastric laparoscopic bypass surgery, which is scheduled for 01/2074.  With regards to his medication, his blood pressure still is not at goal below 130.  As such, I have increased his Toprol-XL from 125 mg to 200 mg p.o. daily.  This medication should be continued through all surgery.  Additionally, if this is not sufficient in bringing his blood pressure down below 130, I would recommend the addition of a diuretic to his regimen either Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. daily.  Additionally, it will be essential that his diabetes be taken better control of and he is now working closely with the diabetes center here at the KCM to do so.  His last A1c was approximately 13 and this is certainly way out of range for someone of his young age.  I am hopeful with continued medical therapy this gentleman can continue to improve his life and undergo orthopedic surgery as well as gastric bypass surgery with significant improvement to his quality of life and future cardiac risk.  With regards to his hypertension, he is on multiple agents including Toprol-XL, Aldactone, Avapro and minoxidil.  Given the multitude of agents, it would be reasonable to screen this gentleman for secondary causes of hypertension including hyperthyroidism as well as hyperaldosteronism, but notably he has currently started the Aldactone and this would be difficult to do while on the medication.  We could consider in the future, if his blood pressure is not well controlled either washing out the Aldactone and then followed by renin and aldosterone testing versus BLANK sampling in the future if deemed necessary.  Additionally, if he is found to have coronary artery disease, one other option despite his lack of claudication would be evaluation of renal artery stenosis.  As mentioned, I will obtain the stress imaging tomorrow morning and then we will be able to have a better assessment of whether or not it would be reasonable to proceed with surgery in the near future.  I will follow back with him in approximately several months' time for followup of his general cardiovascular care.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can do to contribute to his ongoing medical care in the interim.  He has been provided both my e-mail and pager number to contact me if there is anything I can do to assist in his care going forward.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Bellflower Doctors Hospital 

 

 

RE:  TUTTLE, Sandy 

MR#:  2793372 

DOB:  January 16, 2082 

 

 

Dear Dr. Duvall:  

 

Thank you for referring Mr. Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department.  I understand that he is referred here for evaluation of polyneuropathy.  

 

Mr. Tuttle is a 63-year-old right-handed diabetic man who has developed numbness of his lower extremities since 2125.  The numbness started in his toes and gradually spread proximally up to the level of the knees.  In 2135, the numbness started to affect his hands.  In 2139, the patient noted atrophy of the first dorsal interosseous muscles of both hands, left worse than right.  

 

The patient denies any pain in his legs or feet.  He has a five year history of localized low back pain and neck pain radiating to his left upper extremity all the way down to his hands.  In 2125, the patient fell down a ladder from a height of about 30 feet.  According to the patient, he herniated a cervical disk, but surgery was not indicated.  He remembers having pain in his left elbow and neck after the fall.  

 

The patient developed impotence and constipation in 2130.  In 2139, he started to have symptoms of orthostatic hypotension which he described as feeling light-headed, darkening of vision upon standing.  The patient also noted gait imbalance in 2139 prior to his retirement in 2141.  

 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin dependent diabetes since 2123, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, constipation, impotence, macular degeneration of the eyes, retinopathy, s/p laser treatments, history of neck pain and low back pain as mentioned above, history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, skin problems using a number of steroid creams, penile implant in 2130.  

 

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol, Diltiazem, Zestril, Mevacor, steroid creams, Colace, metoclopramide, Naprosyn, insulin.   



ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  

 

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married he has two daughters, 30 and 40 years of age.  He used to work as a Legal Secretary until he retired in December of 2141.  The patient quit smoking in 2107.  He denies any history of alcohol or drug abuse.  

 

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of unclear cause at the age of 45.  His father was diabetic and had heart problems.  Mother died in her 30's.  The patient does not know the cause of death.  The patient had one brother who died in his 50's from diabetic complications.  He had two sister who died of diabetic complications.  Of his two living sisters, one of them is also a diabetic.  The patient's daughters are not diabetic.  There is no known family history of neuromuscular disorders.  

 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Range of motion of the neck is limited.  Head turning 45 degrees to either side.  Limited neck extension.  Negative straight-leg raising.  Negative spine tenderness.  Regular cardiac rhythm, no heart murmur.  Negative carotid bruits.  In the supine position, blood pressure 105/50, heart rate 60 and regular.  Upon standing, blood pressure dropped to 60/40, heart rate remained 60.  The patient was asymptomatic.   



NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:  Mental status:  Alert, coherent and appropriate.  The patient knows the name of his physician, Dr. Duvall, Dr. Villagomez, and Dr. Goldberg at Pioneer Home.  

 

Cranial nerves:  Visual fields full.  Visual acuity with reading glasses 20/30 on the right, 20/20 -1 on the left.  Extraocular movements full.  No nystagmus.  Pupils sluggishly reactive to light.  Optic discs flat bilaterally.  No facial asymmetry.  The tongue and soft palate move symmetrically.  

 

Motor examination:  Atrophy of the first dorsal interosseous and ADM, worse on the left hand.  No atrophy of the abductor pollicis brevis.  Negative arm drift.  Motor strength testing 5/5 in all muscles of both upper extremities except for 4/5 weakness of the first dorsal interosseous and abductor digiti minimi bilaterally.  No weakness of the abductor pollicis brevis on either hand.  Motor strength testing of the lower extremities 5/5 except for mild weakness of toe extensors 4+/5 bilaterally.  The patient was able to walk on his toes and heels while holding onto the examiner.  Deep tendon reflexes 2+ bilaterally at the biceps, triceps, and knees.  Absent ankle jerks bilaterally.  Toes downgoing.  No spasticity of the lower extremities.

   

Sensory examination:  Significant for absent pin prick sensation in both feet up to the level of the knees.  Pin prick sensation is diminished in the dorsal aspect of all fingers and the palmar aspect of both hands.  Vibratory sensation absent in the toes, intact at the ankles and knees bilaterally.  Intact vibratory sensation in the upper extremities.  Romberg test significant for body swaying, but the patient did not fall.  Tandem gait was poor, but improved when holding the examiner.  No limb ataxia.   



LABORATORY DATA:  Review of previous laboratory tests of May, 2145, BUN 36, creatinine 1.7, glucose 310.  December, 2144, TSH normal.  October, 2143, B12 normal.  Negative RPR.  The patient said he was tested negative for HIV in 2142, and 2143.  MRI of the brain in 2142 and 2143 revealed bilateral white matter changes in the cerebral hemisphere without any intracranial mass lesion.   



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  In summary, we have a 63-year-old diabetic man who appears to have significant sensorimotor polyneuropathy with autonomic involvement.  He does have constipation and impotence as well as orthostatic hypotension.  



As we discussed on the phone, his antihypertensive medications need to be adjusted and the patient will be following up with you regarding this.  He may benefit from Jobst stockings to reduce his symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.  I will be ordering an EMG to assess his polyneuropathy and look for any evidence of superimposed ulnar neuropathy or cervical radiculopathy on the left.  The EMG should also include RR interval variations and sympathetic skin responses.  

 

MRI of the cervical spine was also ordered to rule out any cord compression which may also contribute to loss of sensation in the legs.  The patient does have a history of traumatic cervical herniated disk in 2125.  He may also have had a left elbow injury at this time which can make him prone to develop tardy ulnar palsy.  

 

The patient will return for a follow-up visit after the above tests.  

 

Thank you again for referring Mr. Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department.  

 

Sincerely,

RE:Craft, Lloyd

Dear Dr. Short:
 
Today I had the delight of seeing your patient Mr. Craft for the 
possibility of central nervous system vasculitis.  As you know, he 
is a 64 year old, right-handed man with an extensive past medical 
history for a rheumatological disease.  His past medical history, 
briefly, is that he was diagnosed with lupus in 2103 and at that 
time he had a butterfly rash, he complained of chronic fatigue and 
he also had what was considered temporal lobe seizures which were 
characterized as complex partial type events, and elevated double-
stranded DNA of 1:80 and ANA of 1:512 with a homogenous pattern.  
All of these suggested that the patient did have lupus.  He was 
treated for approximately three years with prednisone and he notes 
that after medications were added by Dr. Taliyah Hoffman, his 
symptoms and seizures went away.  Since that time, he has had a 
recurrence of symptoms which includes fullness of his face and 
neck, pressure within his head.  He considers himself to have 
vascular headaches with facial weakness, ringing in his ears, 
numbness and tingling of his left hand and arm, excessive 
salivation and increased appetite. In describing his headache, he 
noted that it is primarily a headache which is there every day and 
has a combination of throbbing sensation as well as throbbing 
quality.  It is worse in the frontal temporal area and is not 
associated with nausea, vomiting or paraesthesias.  There is no 
family history of migraines as well.  Also during his headache 
events, he does not notice any decrease in his appetite or any 
nausea or vomiting.
 
Past medical history:  As per above.  Medicval issues include 
bipolar II with ____________ diagnosed in 2110, hypothalamic 
gonadism, hypothalamic hypothyroidism and questionable history of 
migraine headaches.  
 
His current medications include Lamictal, Risperdal, testolactone, 
chromisene, Levoxyl, Altace for hypertension, ibuprofen p.r.n. and 
prednisone p.r.n.  
 
He is allergic to penicillin, Lozol, bee stings and allopurinol.  
There is a questionable history to Aricept which he feels that the 
use of this medication made his current symptoms come out of 
remission.

Family history is remarkable for insulin dependent diabetes 
mellitus in father and father also had heart disease.  
 
Social history:  He is a former stage manager.  
 
Neurological exam:  He was awake, alert, oriented x 3.  Attention 
was normal.  Speech was fluent, without dysarthria or paraphasic 
errors.  There is no memory deficit or agnosia.  The patient gave 
a very detailed history of events and no further detailed mental 
status testing was performed.  Cranial nerves:  Bilateral visual 
fields were full.  Disks were sharp.  Fundus was clear.  
Extraocular movements were intact.  There was no nystagmus.  He 
had normal facial sensation and symmetry.  Hearing was grossly 
normal.  Uvula, tongue and palate were midline.  Motor examination 
revealed normal tone and bulk with normal strength.  Deep tendon 
reflexes were symmetrical.  There was no upper motor neuron sign.  
Coordination and gait were normal.  
 
Overall impression:  64 year old, right-handed male with a history 
of lupus in the past.  His recent blood work shows that his 
double-stranded DNA was negative.  Taking into consideration his 
current constellation of symptoms and his MRI reports that I 
evaluated which were completely normal except for small vascular 
disease, at this time he does not fit with the diagnosis of 
central nervous system vasculitis.  He was told that he is at a 
high risk for having a stroke secondary to (1) having high blood 
pressure and (2) having an elevated cholesterol.  If it is 
possible to maintain his blood pressure in good control and start 
a cholesterol-lowering agent, he is to discuss this with you, and 
also consider starting aspirin 81mg PO q.d. for primary prevention 
of heart disease.  He was informed that it is possible that there 
is some element of his immune system fluctuations and possibly his 
hormonal therapies may be contributing to some of his 
symptomatology but the diagnosis or etiology of these symptoms is 
not clear.  
 
Thank you for letting me take part in your patient's healthcare.
 
Sincerely,

Lantus and Novolog Insulin Guidelines	



1.	Check blood sugars before meals and at bedtime.  In addition, some meals you may want to check your blood sugar (blood glucose or BG) 1 hour after taking your Novolog.  If it is over 150 you may need to take more Novolog with meals or decrease your carbohydrate intake.  You do not have to do this at every meal and you can alternate meals and/or days.  For example: Sat check before and after breakfast; Friday - lunch; Thursday - supper,etc.

2.	Be careful of the amount of carbohydrates (breads, pasta, cereal, fruit, etc) you eat at each meal and between meals.  Try to average about 60 gms. per meal and 15 gms.  for snacks.

3.	The goal for your blood sugars when you get up in the morning and before meals  is 80-110, 1 hour after taking Novolog (at the start of the meal) it is less than 140, and at bedtime 100 to 140.

4.	Your insulin may need adjusting several times before those goals can be met. When exercising you may need more carbs or less Novolog with meals.  



Long-acting insulin:  Lantus (insulin glargine)

           Take _14_ units at bedtime.  

           Do not mix with any other insulin.  Lantus starts to work in about 1 hr and lasts about 

                24 hours.  It has no peak.

           If your fasting blood sugar for two or more mornings is more than 120, increase your

                Lantus by 2 units at the next dose.  If it is more than 140 for two mornings then     

                increase by 4 units at the next dose.  

            If your fasting blood sugar is less than 70 then decrease your next dose of Lantus 

                 by 2 to 4 units.



Short-acting insulin:  Novolog  

Take 16 units of novolog with breakfast, 6 units with lunch, and 10 units with supper 

   (called  ""standing dose"") within 15 minutes of starting eat your meals. Do not take 

   standing dose if not eating.

Novolog starts to work in 15 minutes and lasts about 2 hours. It peaks in about 1 hour.  

You need to eat enough carbs to cover this insulin or you will have a low blood sugar.  

If blood sugar is < 80 take    your standing dose or sliding scale.  If < 60 do not take standing 

     dose.

Take  Novolog sliding scale (below) in addition to standing dose Novolog at mealtime 

If Blood sugar is   125 - 150 take  2 units more

                             150 - 200 take 3 units more 

                                         201 - 250 take 4 units more  	

                                         251 - 300 take 6 units more  

 			     301 - 350 take 8  units more 

	 >351 take 10 units more and call MD if blood sugar has not 

          decreased or has increased after 2 hours.



Bedtime High Blood Sugar:  If your blood sugar at bedtime is greater than 200 take Novolog by the sliding scale below in addition to Lantus. Do not mix the two insulins.  Do not take standing dose insulin at bedtime. Have your blood sugar checked 1 to 2 hours after taking novolog at bedtime to make sure you haven't gone too low.  If you are below 80 then have a snack and juice to hold you over until morning.

                                  If bedtime blood sugar is 201 - 250 take 2 units

                                                                          251 - 300 take 3 units

                                                                          301 - 350 take 4 units







Please follow up with your endocrinologist or primary care practitioner in 1-2 weeks.  Bring this paper and your blood sugar results from the time you were discharged.  For urgent problems or questions about your blood sugar or insulin call 387-8267 and ask for the page operator.  Have beeper #68537 paged (the diabetes specialist on-call will call you back if you leave a message). You may also try my pager anytime (30568) but I am not always available.

Conner, Andrew
MR #9911852
May 18, 2071

Andy comes in for followup of hospitalization on May 6, for coronary artery disease and he had
increasing angina pectoris leading to catheterization.  He underwent angioplasty of the
circumflex vessels and then angioplasty and stenting of the first diagonal branch to the LAD. 
The latter one was done in the second setting and part of the study where the ____ the stent
versus a plain stent.  This was done by Dr. Winn, and Dr. Cook.  Since then he has been
tired, otherwise felt well.  He had reasonable lipids but low HDL syndrome.  His blood sugars
have been controlled recently with A1C's in the 6 range.  He is overweight and does not do any
regular exercise program.  He is on        for arthritis.  

His current medications consist of aspirin 325 mg per day, Plavix 75 mg per day, Glucatrol 10
mg twice daily and Glucophage 500 mg twice daily, Atenolol 25 mg daily, Nexium 20 mg per
day, Flomax .4 and Zestril. He feels well.  He is a little fatigued.  No obvious angina.  His blood
pressure is running 110/70, his pulse is running 60 and regular.  JVP is normal. Carotids are
normal.  The lungs are clear.  Coronary:  S3.

IMPRESSION:  Doing well.  I think he should probably be on Lipitor even though he is on low
lipids and I also think that he would benefit from cardiac rehabilitation. He will also pay close
attention to diabetes and he is prepared to move on with insulin.

Assessment

Type 2 DM complicated by PVD and neuropathy.  He was not eating well 7/01-7/02 but says his appetite has now recovered.



Recommendation

1.  Continue NPH insulin 25 units q am and 10 units q hs.

2.  Suggest to change regular insulin sliding scale to humalog as this is more physiologic (acts faster and clears faster as well).  Give only half doses of this at hs since he will not be eating then.

3.  Please get a Hemoglobin A1c.  This will help us assess blood glucose control for the past 2-3 months and can help in discharge planning.

4.  He should folow-up with Dr. Dunn from Diabetes.





Thank you.

Asked by Dr Dunn and Dr. Needham to comment on DM management in this 58 y/o man admited for amputation site debridement. He had fem-pop in 2080, and a R toe amp in 9/80. Howevere the site never healed, despite lack of clear infection. He is readmited on 3/28 for debridement. 



Narrative History

Type 2 DM diagnosed in  2078 - presented with urinary frequency and was not feeling well. He was admitted to the hospital for BG's of 400's and discharged on NPH insulin 30 units q am and 15 units q pm.  He has followed up with Dr. Dunn from our Diabetes department. He has not seen her since 3/80 but has kept up with her by phone. His home DM regimen consists of NPH insulin 25 units q am and 10 units q hs. Last A1c was 6.1 3/80 and his BG's run ~ 100. 



He has hypoglycemia unawareness.

He has PVD s/p fem-fem bypass graft 6/30/80, ulcer on R big toe, (+)peripheral neuropathy.

Assessment

Type 2 DM complicated by PVD and neuropathy.  Well controlled on his home regimen. 

Recommendation

1.  Continue NPH insulin 25 units q am and 10 units q hs.

2.  Suggest to change regular insulin sliding scale to humalog as this is more physiologic (acts faster and clears faster as well).  Give only half doses of this at hs since he will not be eating then.

3.  Please get a Hemoglobin A1c.  This will help us assess blood glucose control for the past 2-3 months and can help in discharge planning.

4.  He should folow-up with Dr. Dunn from Diabetes.





Thank you.

Quinton Sparks, M.D.
Cardiovascular Division

Changchun, LA  14176

Dear Quin,

Just a note for the records regarding Ms. Xanders's recent admission to our Cardiology Service between 08/09/2087 and 08/12/2087.  As you know, she is a lovely 47-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, cigarette smoking and end-stage renal disease for which she underwent transplantation in 2083. She is now under evaluation for pancreatic transplantation.  She has not had symptoms of angina or left ventricular dysfunction and LVEF has been normal.  An exercise test in July 2087 achieved 79% of the maximal predicted heart rate, no chest discomfort, but 1-mm of ST depression in the lateral leads.  Her other recent issues have included marked anemia, possibly related to her immunosuppressive drugs (negative upper and lower endoscopy) and transient hyperglycemia following a glucocorticoid bolus.

At the time of admission, the hematocrit remained in the low 20s and she was transfused in preparation for cardiac catheterization.  Appropriate bicarbonate and Mucomyst therapies were administered, and we also took advantage of the precatheterization time to reinforce the importance of smoking cessation.

Coronary angiography on 08/11/2087 demonstrated a co-dominant system with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery with left to right collaterals perfusing that territory.  There was also a 95% stenosis of the proximal LAD.  After careful consideration of the options, Dr. Valdez placed a Cypher stent at that location successfully.  She tolerated the procedure well,  was ambulatory the following morning and the creatinine had actually improved to 2.0; the hematocrit remained ""stable"" in the mid 20s.  She will likely be discharged later today, following a discussion with the renal transplant service regarding augmenting her antihypertensive regime.

She understands the importance of uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy,  preferably for more than one year.

It was a pleasure to participate in Ms. Xanders's care.  A copy of the discharge abstract as list of discharge medications will be forwarded to you separately.

With best regards.

Sincerely yours,

TEAM 2 ADMISSION NOTE





Name: Victoria Justice

Date of admission: 1/30/2094	

Attending:  Dr. Ledford

PCP: Dr. Faith Ice

 

History compiled from patient's record and son

CC:  altered mental status



HPI:  83yo female with a h/o dementia, HTN, DM, Afib, PMR, and chronic diarrhea sent from her assisted living facility for altered mental status and suspected UTI.  Per the patient's son, the staff at her facility has noted the patient to be more confused over the last 3 days.  She has had more frequent episodes of fecal incontinence with soiling of her bed and carpet. Some blood was also noted in her toilet. Her son also reports that she has been less awake than usual and has had some congestion and coughing.  She has had no fevers, chills, chest pain, sob, nausea, vomiting, or urinary symptoms. A urinalysis was reportedly positive at her assisted living facility and the patient was sent to the emergency department for further evaluation. 



At baseline, the patient is generally quite confused.  She knows her name and often location but not the date/year and talks frequently of her late husband and parents whom she believes are still alive. Her assisted living facility has recently suggested that she be transferred to their higher level of care program.



ED: T 98.1, P 110, R 20, BP 130/56, SaO2 98% RA. She has dry MM. Lungs clear. Heart irregular. AAOx1 and otherwise nonfocal neuro exam. Her initial labs were notable for a Hct of 44.6 which was 34.5 on repeat. Rectal exam brown stool guaiac positive. CXR showed no sign of pneumonia. Urinalysis was negative for any signs of infection. Blood cultures were sent. The patient was treated with levofloxacin 500mg po and 3LNS, as well as many of her home meds, including Lopressor, Sotalol, prednisone, iron, thiamine, folic acid, mvi, calcium, glyburide, and effexor. Aspirin was held. She was transfused one unit of PRBCs and admitted to medicine for further evaluation.

CXR 1/29/95: minimal left basilar subsegmental atelectasis



EKG: aflutter with variable block, no ischemic changes



A/P:  83 yo female with dementia, HTN, DM, AF, and PMR with worsening mental status over several days. Per report, her urinalysis was positive at her living facility, however there is no evidence of urinary or other infection now (now WBC or fever; CXR neg, Ucx/Blcx NG). Suspect her altered mental status is secondary to progressive dementia and dehydration. The patient was also noted to have blood in her stool at home and a 10 point Hct drop in the emergency department. While the patient did get 3L of fluid in between which could cause dilutional anemia, given the patient's history of blood in stool and guaiac positivity, will work-up possible GI bleed. 



1.	Decreased Hct- GIB v. dilutional.  Does have h/o diverticulitis.

a.	Serial Hcts q8

b.	2 large bore IVs at all times

c.	Consider GI consult if Hct continues to drop for possible EGD/colonoscopy (although pt has had multiple unsuccessful colonoscopy attempts in past)

d.	Nexium 40mg po qd

2.	AMS- likely progressive dementia in setting of dehydration. 

a.	F/u urine and blood cultures

b.	Hold antibiotics as no clear source of infection

c.	Check TSH, B12, folate, LFTs, lytes

d.	Hydrated in ED

e.	Check head CT

f.	Attempt to wean effexor; consult geri-psych per attending

3.	Rhythm- has h/o afib and SVT, now in aflutter with variable block. HR goes up with activity and when due for meds.

a.	Cont lopressor, sotalol, digoxin

b.	Hold aspirin for possible GIB

c.	Telemetry monitoring

4.	Hyperlipidemia- statin recently increased

a.	Check fasting lipids

b.	LFTs

5.	Diabetes- glyburide recently increased. Will hold for now in case needs to be NPO.

a.	RISS coverage

Dr. Wilma Field

Dear Wil,



INTERVAL HISTORY:

Mrs. Ulibarri returned today for follow-up of coronary artery disease, post recent CABG.  As you know, her course was complicated by heparin induced thrombocytopenia, and she has been continued on Coumadin anticoagulation.  She has done relatively well in five weeks since surgery and her energy level has improved.  The major ongoing symptoms is aching in the upper part of the sternum, and an opening in the lower part of the incision which drains some purulent material.  She also has a suture and her leg which has worked its way to the surface and causes some discomfort.  Her breathing is much better than preoperatively, and she has had no chest pain.  She has very mild residual dyspnea.  She has had mild edema at times, but it has largely resolved.  She has had no fever.



Review of Systems:                                                                                                  .

All of the following are normal or negative.  GENERAL:  night sweats, fever and chills.  HEAD AND NECK: headaches, hoarseness.  RESPIRATORY: cough, coughing up blood.  CARDIOVASCULAR: see history above.  GASTROINTESTINAL: frequent heartburn or indigestion, difficulty swallowing, black or tarry stools, nausea/vomiting.  URINARY: frequent urination at night, urinary tract infections, blood in urine.  NEUROLOGIC: transient paralysis, seizures, visual loss in one eye.  HEMATOLOGIC: easy bruising.  SKIN: new rashes or eruptions, poor healing of foot sores, moles that are changing size.  ENDOCRINE: elevated blood sugars, thyroid problems.  MUSCULOSKELETAL: low back pain, joint pains, joint swelling.



Family and Social History:

Family and social history have not changed.  There is no pertinent new information which has bearing on the current problems.



Physical Examination: .

She looks quite well.  Her blood pressure is 160/80.  Central venous pressure is normal and lungs are clear.  There is mild tenderness with no redness or swelling over the upper end of the sternum, and there is a 1 cm in diameter opening of the incision at the lower end, with sero-purulent drainage.  Lungs are clear.  Heart shows regular rhythm and I hear no rub or murmur.  Liver is not palpable and there is no edema.  There was a small end of a suture from the small leg incision, which I clipped off.



Electrocardiogram: .

Normal sinus rhythm.  Anterior T-wave inversion, somewhat to tracing.  Before the operation.



Overall, Mrs. Ulibarri is improved.  I asked him concerns about possible smoldering infection of her sternum.  I will send her to Trevino made to for the surgical team to violate this, and will then a CT scan of her chest and sternum looking for any collection of pus.



I have encouraged her to continue to be active.  Her walking is limited by pain, which limits or exercise.  She has already returned to her part-time work.



I made no change in her regimen today.  Our plan to see her again a couple of months and she will continue on Coumadin anticoagulation.  I'll keep you posted.



							Sincerely yours,







							William C. Sargent, M.D.

Pt says he can't stop eating after 3-4 pm, gets enraged, aggressive, anxious, restless, (was given barbiturate and Ativan prn for this, and has improved somewhat ~40%) eats 1/2 gallon of ice cream per day, eats as aggressively as he feels, ongoing for 1.5 yrs.  Afraid he will do something aggressive, and uses entering a ""food-coma"" to help restrain himself.  Has bipolar, is in ""mixed state"" now, with characteristics of both depr and mania.  Has neurendoc MD, thinking his pattern related to ""peak endocrine secretions"".



Had binge drinking episodes till 2 yrs ago.  Drank for 2 days when switching into mania.  Learned to use substitution.  Learned to recognize mania coming on, prodrome, less need for sleep, euphoric speech, spending money.  Wife helped identify this.  Substituted going boating, listening to music, walking, talking to friends.



Wonders if substitution method can work for eating.  A potential method is to use 8 oz water or dietetic candy which have worked to satisfy his hunger.



Learned aggression is PTSD.  Rel to betrayal by mother at age 13.  Trapped, helpless, boxed in.  Medical ailments make him feel the same way.



Has has had talking therapy for ETOH, never for PTSD.

Gained 20# over last 1.5 yrs w/ psych-induced eating as above.

  Family weight hx: F was built like pt, M 98# and could ""outeat any man and never gained wt"".

  Eating habits: Bingeing?     Night eating?   Excessive hunger?  No   Feels fullness? Yes   Eat past full?  YES   Full details per dietician note.

  Emotional factors/triggers of eating:  See HPI

  Exercise:  HS football westling, military wrestling, coll wrestling, 7 mi/d run, tennis for 20 yrs w/ wife.  Currently walks dog 4 miles a day, ""not at aerobic speed"".

Joshua A. Root, M.D.

980 Westwood Dr, Suite 8466
Bangkok, NJ  53591

Dear Dr. Root:

We had the pleasure of seeing this patient today in followup of his transplant of 03/25/2084.  He is doing quite well.  There are no exertional complaints of dyspnea or chest discomfort.  He is taking his medications without problems and denies fever, cough, rash or diarrhea.

He tells me his blood pressures at home are as high as 140-160 in the morning systolic dropping to the 130 systolic in the evenings.

His current medications are unchanged and include Neoral 125 mg b.i.d., prednisone 15 mg daily, CellCept 1 g b.i.d., aspirin 325 mg daily, Bactrim double strength one tablet every other day, calcium and vitamin D one tablet b.i.d., diltiazem CD 240 mg q.a.m. and 120 q.p.m., Lantus Insulin 20 units at bedtime, magnesium gluconate 500 mg b.i.d., multivitamin daily, Neurontin 100 mg t.i.d., NovoLog insulin p.r.n., nystatin elixir 5 mL q.i.d., omeprazole 40 mg daily, Valcyte 450 mg daily, vitamin C 500 mg b.i.d., and vitamin E 400 mg b.i.d.

On exam, he looks great.  His blood pressure is 166/98 initially, 148/82 on repeat.  His heart rate is 110.  He weighs 163 pounds.  His head and neck examination is unremarkable.  His venous pressures are less than 7 cm of water.  The lungs are clear.  The cardiac exam reveals a tachycardic rhythm with no rub, murmur or gallop.  The abdomen is unremarkable.  His numerous surgical wounds are well healed.  His extremities are warm without edema.

Electrocardiography is notable for sinus tachycardia at 108 beats per minute, some nonspecific ST changes.  He underwent right heart catheterization and biopsy today.  His right atrial pressure was 5.  His wedge pressure was 17.  His PA pressures were 40/20 with a mean of 30.  The biopsy results are pending at the time of this dictation.

In summary, the patient is doing well now six weeks after cardiac transplantation.  We will be making changes to his immunosuppressive regimen as dictated by the results of his blood work and biopsy.  It is very gratifying to see how well he is doing.  We will be sure to update you on a regular basis.

Sincerely,

HPI:  Patient is a 59-year old who has a history or active issues 
significant for hypertension first diagnosed on visit of 10-74.  She is 
currently maintained on furosemide 20 mg. PO q.d., nifedipine XL 90 mg. PO 
q.d., and potassium chloride 10 ml. equivalents PO q.d.  Patient comes in 
today for a routine follow up of her blood pressure, as well as routine 
baseline examinations.  On her last visit, her blood pressure was 160/90, 
and on check today it was 150/90.  We discussed the possibility that she 
continue her salt-restricted diet.  We also discussed that she continue 
her own exercise, both of which she does faithfully, and we also discussed 
the possibility of her trying to gradually lose weight.  She currently 
weighs 199 lbs. and stands approximately 4'9"" tall.  
 
As far as long-term prognosis, my current plan is to evaluate her blood 
pressure on another subsequent visit in the next 6-8 weeks and at that 
time if it is elevated, we will consider either going up on her nifedipine 
XL dose or going up on her furosemide medicine, seeing if we can possibly 
gain some better control or possibly adding another agent.  However, at 
this point she seems to be doing much better with this new blood pressure 
and this is significant improvement maintenance from her previous blood 
pressure on her first admission, which was systolic blood pressures in the 
200s-190s.
 
 
Her family situation which was somewhat unstable at her first presentation 
now appears to be much more stable.  She is currently living with her 
mother and she says that she she is enjoying her new sense of feeling good 
about her self with regard to exercise and maintenance of her diet.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAM:  BP: 150/90   Lungs: clear bilaterally.  Heart: RRR, no 
murmurs.  Abdomen: distended, obese, no evidence of HSM or any focal 
tenderness.  She had good pulses distally with no evidence of trace 
swelling bilaterally at the ankles.   Breast exam: no evidence of masses 
or lumps.
 
She will follow up with me in 6-8 weeks, at which time she will have a 
mammogram performed as well as a Pap smear, cholesterol test, and stool 
guaiacs.  Advance directives were not discussed and it is not a pertinent 
issue at this point.

Re:  Umstead, Kenneth
     MR #401-10-87-8
 
Dear Jac:
 
I saw your patient, Kenneth Umstead, in the Cardiology office today
and he seems to be doing very well from a cardiovascular
perspective.  Apparently he has had guaiac positive stools and has
undergone a colonoscopy with the identification of four polyps. 
Three have been removed and he then had a GI bleed.  This has been
reevaluated and he has been stable.  The fourth polyp will need to
be removed at a later time.  At this point, his aspirin has been
discontinued for a number of days and the Lopid was also
discontinued apparently because of increased liver function tests. 
His current medications therefore include Lasix 40 mg per day,
Metoprolol 25 mg qd, Nifedipine XL 30 mg qd.  He is aware of a
belching and burping sensation after eating but otherwise no
exertional or other related symptoms.  He is reasonably active but
somewhat limited by his claudication.
 
On exam today, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 130/70,
a heart rate of 65 and regular.  Head and neck were unremarkable. 
Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distension
at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 are normal with a
physiologic split.  There is an S4 and a I/VI systolic ejection
murmur at the left sternal border.  Abdominal exam was
unremarkable.  Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.  
 
His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus
rhythm with left axis deviation and a nonspecific left
intraventricular conduction delay.
 
Jacob Bautista, M.D.
Re:  Umstead, Kenneth
July 04, 2073
Page 2
 
 
I think Mr. Umstead is basically doing quite well.  It would be of
value to repeat an exercise test since he has not had one since
2069.  He had minimal ischemia at that time.  There are no symptoms
that would prompt cardiac catheterization at this point and we will
see how he does on the exercise test with the objective findings. 
 
 
If any problems develop, please don't hesitate to contact me. 
Thank you very much for allowing me to help with his care.
 
Kindest personal regards.
 
Sincerely yours,

EDVISIT^42817774^AARON, JEAN^08/04/77^VALENTIN, IDA

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post fall, right shoulder pain.

I saw the patient with Dr. Andrew Newhouse.  Please see his note for

further details.  I confirm that I have interviewed and examined

the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation, and discussed

the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63-year-old female

who presents after mechanical trip and follow at work today and

hit her forehead.  No loss of consciousness, no headache, no

visual changes, no upper or lower extremities, paresthesias or

weakness.  She fell onto her right shoulder, is complaining about

pain at that area.  No focal weakness, no neck pain, no back

pain, no chest pain, shortness of breath, no belly pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes,

hypercholesterolemia, neuropathy, and diverticulitis.

MEDICATIONS:  Currently on Novolog, verapamil, lisinopril,

amitriptyline, and aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  No known allergies

SOCIAL HISTORY:  One pack per day smoker and does not drink.  She

denies IV drug use.  She lives alone.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per resident's note and my HPI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is awake, alert, and nontoxic but does

appear uncomfortable.  Afebrile, vital signs are notable for a

blood pressure of 185/79, O2 saturation 99% on room air,

respiratory rate 18, and pulse 89.  HEENT exam:  Normocephalic

and atraumatic.  No facial tenderness.  No cervical spine

tenderness in the midline.  Lungs:  Clear anteriorly.  No TLS

spine tenderness in the midline.  Heart:  Regular rate and

rhythm.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Her right

shoulder that is held by her side, she has exquisite tenderness,

unable to really move it.  She has intact axillary nerve

sensation, full strength in her hand and fingers.  Alert and

oriented x3.  Normal mood and affect.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient thought she hit her

forehead does not have signs or symptoms suggestive of

intracerebral injuries.  I do not feel she needs imaging though

she has pain in her shoulder.  She is awake and alert and answers

questions appropriately.  She has no cervical spine tenderness in

the midline.  She did have plain films of her right shoulder that

show comminuted fracture of the right humerus involving the

surgical neck, greater tuberosity, anatomic neck with medial

displacement distal fragment.  She also had a chest x-ray that

showed some mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  The patient had

preoperative screening labs that included sodium 138, K 4.2,

chloride 101, bicarbonate 25, BUN 20, creatinine 1.4, glucose 395

and calcium 10.  White count of 27, hematocrit 41, and platelet

count 286,000.  Coags within normal limits. 

The patient will be admitted to the Orthopedics Surgery.  We will

check UA given her white count.  Of note, she did have her

differential still pending.

DIAGNOSIS:  Right shoulder fracture status post mechanical fall.

DISPOSITION:  Admitted to Ortho.

CONDITION:  Stable.  She will also be treated for hyperglycemia,

which is also another diagnosis.

OLIVIER,CHRISTINE   652-33-21-5                     VISIT DATE: 10/05/75
PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Chest pain. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The resident's note was reviewed, 
and the patient seen and examined on arrival.  This is a 
65-year-old female status post multiple angioplasties and stent 
placement.  She had recurrence of her typical angina at home, took 
three nitroglycerin with minimal relief, and activated the 911 
system.  Her pre-hospital electrocardiogram shows a small amount of 
ST depression, perhaps 1 mm, and flattening V3-V6.  This is 
comparable to a previous electrocardiogram in October, which may 
have been her most recent presentation with ischemia.  She was 
given aspirin and nitroglycerin, and continued to have pain in the 
Emergency Department.  The total duration of pain was approximately 
two hours. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her vital signs remained stable. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Her initial enzymes were flat. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  She is being taken to the Cardiac 
Catheterization Laboratory for an urgent study to rule out acute 
coronary syndrome. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Rule out unstable angina. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 
taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory.  The condition at 
the time of this dictation is favorable.

	Interval History:
   Ms. Ulrich is a 88 yo w/ h/o CAD, DM2, and dyslipidemia, who was admitted 10 d ago with an inferior STEMI in the setting of nauseau and CP, who subsequently received BMS stents to the RPLV and mid RCA.  Plavix was reloaded for 1 week in this setting.  She was discharged to a rehab facility in pauls valley 8/10/96 for PT/OT.  At the rehab facility she developed hematemesis and was admitted to the medicine service last night for UGIB.  She denies CP/SOB/N at present.  She does not have memory of the hematemesis episodes overnight.  She required some reorientation to the situation leading to her readmission.

2. HTN/Hypertensive heart disease: rather difficult to control HTN, needing multiple agents to achieve near normal to high normal pressures.  Had a good bp response to thiazides but caused unacceptable degree of hyponatremia.  BP also related to the degree of chronic low back pain, and was substantially better for 6 months after localized treatment.  Hypertensive HD manifest primarily as peripheral edema, worsened by norvasc, improved on diuretic.

	Family history:
   There is a history of non-premature cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease:  Her father died of a stroke in his 80s, her mother had congestive heart failure, and a brother had an MI.  Her other siblings have lived into their 80s.


	Social history:
   She has not smoked, and uses alcohol only rarely.  She lives at home with her youngest daughter, Vaccaro.  Another daughter, Tiffany, has been also very involved in her mother's care.


	Review of systems:
   As above, otherwise negative in detail. 

Physical examination:
	
-Pulse: 58  
-resp. rate:  16  
-Abdomen:   soft NT and ND, no hepatosplenomegaly, no pulsatile masses.
-Neuro:   a + oriented to self, needs orientation to location and context
-Extremities:   trace lower extremity edema, 1+ bilat PT pulses, 2+ radial pulses
-Chest:   cleart to auscultation anteriorly without crackles or wheezes
-Neck:   JVP not elevated, no HJR, no carotid bruits
-HEENT:   NC/AT, with mild ptosis of left eyelid from post herpetic changes
-General appearance:   A WD, WN elderly woman in no acute distress. Answering questions propriately, but requiring reorientation.
-BP: 155/60  


	EKG:
   NSR, CRO old IMI, NSSTTWAs, no significant change


	Impression:
   88 yo woman with extensive CAD history, HTN and DM2 recently started on oral agents, now presents with UGIB in setting of plavix extended reload of 150 QD x 1 week.

Agree with reducing plavix to 75 QD for now in combination with low dose ASA.  Despite low level cardiac marker elevation there is little suggest an intercurrent coronary syndrome currently complicating the UGIB.  Would try to continue antiplatelet therapy for a minimum of 30 days, and preferably for 90 days in the setting of recently placed bare metal stents, if tolerable from a hemodynamic and hemostatic perspective.  Agree with switching to short term beta blocker, and holding lasix for now given apparent volume depletion.  Continue high dose statin, ARB, and low dose CCB for BP control.

If UGIB continues to stabilize would prefer to maintain on H2 blocker rather than PPI to limit interference with antiplatelet therapy with plavix.  

Will follow with you.

ENDOCRINE/DIABETES STAFF CONSULTATION

Patient: VAUGHN, FRANK			MANAMANA MRN: 6767510
Requesting MD: Dr. Quale			Service: SICU

CC/ID: Asked to see this 33 y/o M admitted with Fourier's gangrene, s/p multiple surgical procedures, for DM management

HPI/ROS: Pt is a 33 y/o with DM-2 who was in his USH until about 2 weeks PTA, when he developed buttock pain.  He had some purulent D/C from rectum and worsening of glucose control.  He was seen in EDUCARE-PULLMAN Urgent Care on 1/21/77 at which time a small erythematous and tender cyst was noted between his buttocks.  He was prescribed sitz baths and Keflex for pilonidol cyst vs. ruptured boil.  He was seen again in EDUCARE-PULLMAN on 1/29/77 at which time he reported resolution of his buttock pain.  He denied fevers or neurologic symptoms.  Exam was notable for only a tiny pustule in the upper gluteal cleft, minimally erythematous, non-tender, without drainage.  On the morning of 2/01/77 he developed worsening of his shortness of breath, followed by the development of left jaw pain, and cold sweats, so he presented to the MANAMANA ED.  On presentation, he also admitted to three days of scrotal and perineal pain and swelling.  In the ED he was tachycardic to 113, normotensive, initially low-grade fever, but later spiked to 102.9.  On examination, there was severe bilateral testicular swelling and pain, with a fluctuant mass between the rectum and scrotum.  His WBC was 18,000 with 91% PMNs.  An abdominal CT revealed extensive subcutaneous edema in the perineum, with multiple foci of air consistent with a necrotizing infection; and extensive fluid in the scrotum, consistent with Fournier's gangrene.  The patient was treated with IV Abx and was taken urgently to the OR, where he underwent extensive debridement at which time substantial necrosis and pus were discovered.  He was admitted to the SICU and has since undergone multiple debridements, last on 2/20/77.

In terms of his DM, he has type 2 diagnosed in October 2075.  At the time he was feeling ""lousy,"" tired, nauseated, and increased urinary frequency: went to Payson Hospital and FS was 376.  Pt was admitted overnight and given insulin; started on Metformin 500 bid, eventually insulin was added.  He was being followed by Dr. Talley at the Promptcare but stopped going there.  Most recently treated with Lantus 50 units at bedtime plus maximal doses of Glipizide 10 bid and Metformin 1000 bid, with uncontrolled HbA1c (see below).  He has microalbuminuria.  He is unable to give me a full history.

In the SICU he has been treated with an insulin drip, which oscillates between 4-11 U/hr.  He is being fed with Glucerna continuous TF at 120 cc/hr, and has been started on NPH 50 U q12h.

Impression:  33 y/o M with DM-2 requiring insulin, uncontrolled PTA, here recovering from Fournier's gangrene, still in ICU with multiple IV Abx and being fed with TF, requiring high doses of insulin both IV and SQ.

Pt's insulin requirement is very large due to 1) marked insulin resistance secondary to obesity, 2) ongoing infection and critical illness, and 3) enteral TF.

Would maintain on insulin drip while titrating NPH doses upwards by 10 U q12h each dose as long as czi drip is needed.  Considering his current requirement of at least 120 U IV/24h on top of his SQ doses, he will probably need close to 100 U q12h.  Could safely increase his NPH to 80 U q12h right now.

Would make sure that in the Instructions to this order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose if that happens.

Recommend:
1. Increase NPH to 80 U q12h
2. Titrate NPH doses upwards by 10 U q12h each dose as long as czi drip is needed
3. Please make sure that in the Instructions to the NPH order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose (especially if pt transfers to floor)
4. Would consider reintroducing ACEi for kidney protection into his BP regimen (e.g. Lisinopril 10 mg daily)
5. Pt will likely need fibrate for hypertriglyceridemia as he improves

Thank you for interesting consult
Dr. Tan will follow

27 Caroll St, #734 
Bluefield, ME 12111 

Dear Dr. Easterling: 

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Brian Martin in the Cardiology Service on 10/28/2078. He has a history of chest pain and was evaluated at Klickitat Valley Hospital for the same by you and, I believe, Dr. Inglis. He reportedly had an echo and a treadmill test that were unconcerning. 

His episodes of chest pain are interesting. He feels a sharp pain for maybe a second or two in his chest followed by rapid palpitations associated with some jaw aching. The palpitations are of sudden onset as well as sudden offset. They were occurring up to one time per day through his hospitalization at Klickitat Valley a couple of weeks ago and now have occurred on two occasions since discharge. He is otherwise in fairly good health.


	Past medical history:
   1) Nonalcoholic steatotic hepatosis 
2) Palpitations 
3) Rotator cuff surgery in 2071

	

	Allergies:
	
No known drug allergy


	Medications (Confirmed):

	
aspirin  81 mg po daily
penicillin VK  500 mg po 4 x day


	Family history:
   Mother died at age 62 of a heart attack. He has four siblings, all in good health. 


	Social history:
   He is married with two sons, age 21 and 18, both of whom are in good health. He works as an Revenue Officer for Springfield Armory Inc in Picture Rocks, Maine.

Habits: He has never used street drugs. He does not smoke tobacco. He drinks 6 beers/alcohol per week and 2 cups of coffee per day.


	Review of systems:
   Negative in detail as detailed on his questionnaire and confirmed during the office visit.

Physical examination:
	
-BP: 110/70  
-Pulse: 59  BPM regular
-resp. rate: 16  unlabored
-Skin:   without lesions or nodules.
-HEENT:   EOMI.  PERRLA.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Conjunctivae noninjected.  Mucous membranes moist.  No oropharyngeal lesions.
-Neck:   carotids 2+ without bruits; jugular venous pressure &lt;5 cm of water; thyroid without nodules; trachea midline.
-Chest:   lungs clear to auscultation, resonant to percussion, and symmetric in expansion.
-Cardiac:   regular with a normal S1/S2; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
-Abdomen:   soft, nontender, without organomegaly or other masses.
-Extremities:   no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
-Neuro:   reflexes were 1+; cranial nerves 2-12 were intact; motor and sensory modalities were intact in all four extremities.


	EKG:
   10/28/2078: Sinus bradycardia. Otherwise the tracing is within normal limits.


	Assessment and plan:
   Mr. Martin has episodic palpitations associated with some chest discomfort. Sometimes it is difficult for patients to distinguish between palpitations and chest pain per se. It may also be that his palpitations raise his heart rate to the point where he becomes ischemic, notwithstanding the negative stress test that he had in the past. 

We will request the records of the echo and the stress test so we can have them for our files here and I have asked him to complete a 30-day event recording and follow up with me after that has been completed. 

I will certainly keep you informed about how things progress. 

Yours truly,

Mr. Fredrick returns to clinic three years following right middle lobectomy for T1N0 carcinoid.  He is a 50-year-old man without symptomatic complaints.  He denies any stridor, wheezing, productive cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis or fever.  He had a recent chest CT scan which was of concern to him.

On physical exam today, the patient appears quite well.  HEENT examination shows no JVD or thyromegaly.  No supraclavicular, cervical or axillary adenopathy is noted.  His blood pressure today is 132/92, with a regular heart rate and rhythm of 86.  S1 and S2 are within normal limits; there is no murmur, rub or gallop.  His resting O2 saturation is 98% on room air, with a respiratory rate of 16 per minute.  His temperature is 98.6, and his weight is 228 pounds.  Chest examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally to percussion and auscultatory examination.  He has good chest wall excursion and no evidence of wheezing.  He does not have any egophony.  His abdomen is soft, nondistended and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly; and his extremities show no evidence of edema, cyanosis or clubbing.  The surgical wound is well-healed.  There is no evidence of local recurrence.

The chest CT scan shows two small nodules that do not appear to have significantly changed given the correction for volume averaging. The area of his previous resection shows no suggestion of recurrence.

In summary, Mr. Fredrick has two small pulmonary abnormalities that are not particularly suggestive of recurrent disease.  I agree with Dr. Ordonez's plan to repeat the CT scan in four months.

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  Elizabeth Keys, M.D.



CHIEF COMPLAINT:  diabetes management.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Fair is a 61-year-old patient with a history of diabetes diagnosed more than 20 years ago.  He has known complication of retinopathy and is status post bilateral laser surgery about one year ago.  He has no known neuropathy or nephropathy.  He has no known history of CAD, CVA or PVD.  He had previously been followed by Dr. Elizabeth Keys at Pioneer Hospital at Findlay until June of this year which time he switched to a new primary care doctor.  At that time, he had been on glyburide, metformin and Avandia, his new PCP increased his glyburide and his Avandia.  He also stopped his hydrochlorothiazide out of concern that this is not an ideal agent for a diabetic patient. Over the next weeks to months, the patient had progressive peripheral edema, fluid weight gain and ultimately development of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  He returned for care and was started on furosemide and has been recently titrated up to a dose of 60 mg orally on this.  He self adjusted his Avandia dose from 4 mg twice daily to 2 mg daily.  His prebreakfast blood glucose has been elevated ranging from 160-200.  He has had some resolution of his fluid overload with the Lasix and lower dose Avandia.  He says he has persistent feeling of swelling and tightness in his fingers and toes with episodic ankle swelling as well.  He denies chest pain, claudication polyuria, polydipsia.  He has been losing weight since starting Lasix.  He has never had hypoglycemia.



DIABETES SURVELLIANCE AND MANAGEMENT:

Hemoglobin A1c 11.4% (10/01/84).

Cholesterol 190, LDL cholesterol 190, HDL 49 (10/01/84) and LDL 118 (07/02/84).

Microalbumin to creatinine 19 (07/02/84).

Creatinine 0.9 (07/02/84).

Last eye exam 09/83.

Pneumovax never.

Influenza vaccine never.

Aspirin 325 mg daily.

ACE inhibitor yes (lisinopril 10 mg daily,).

Statin yes (Lipitor 40 mg daily).



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

Diabetes as above.

Diabetic retinopathy.

Hypertension.

Osteoarthritis of the knees.

Status post hammertoe repair.

Pilonidal cyst status post I&D.

Severed Achilles tendon status post repair.

Right meniscus removal.



MEDICATIONS: Glyburide 10 mg twice daily, metformin 1000 mg twice daily and the Avandia 2 mg daily, Lipitor 40 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily.  furosemide 60 mg daily, multivitamin one tablet daily and Viagra as needed.



ALLERGIES:  Amoxicillin gives him a rash.



FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  He works as a manager in a convenience store, he lives with his wife.  He has no kids.  He does not exercise secondary to joint pain.  He tends to eat a lot of carbohydrates and meats although he does not have a sweet tooth.  He denies tobacco, alcohol or recreational drug use.  



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per HPI, otherwise, negative.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His weight is 270 pounds, his blood pressure is 150/92 and then 155/92 to my a repeat exam, pulse is 70 and regular.  In general, he is a well-appearing gentleman in no acute distress.  His skin is warm and dry.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx is clear.  Mucous membranes are moist.  He has no carotid bruits.  His thyroid is normal in size and contour.  Lung exam reveals crackles at the bases.  His heart is regular in rate and rhythm with an S1, S2, without S3 or S4.  Abdomen is obese, soft and nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  His extremities are without clubbing or cyanosis.  There is 2+ pitting edema to the ankles.  His foot exam reveals that his distal pulses are okay.  Sensation is intact to monofilament.  There is no skin breakdown or ulcerations.  He has an extensive onychomycosis of the nails bilaterally.



Glucose 132.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 61-year-old gentleman with type II diabetes complicated by retinopathy and erectile dysfunction.  He has had inadequate glycemic control on oral agents which are currently at their maximal doses given the intolerable side effects of Avandia.  He has plans for elective knee replacement during the spring and we have advised him that before he consider that he should get his diabetes under better control, should make sure his blood pressure is controlled and should seek cardiac evaluation, especially given his history of pulmonary edema symptoms on Avandia.



1.  We will start insulin today initially NPH 25 units at bedtime to replace his evening dose of glyburide.  We have instructed him on use of the Inolet for insulin administration.  He will continue his glyburide 10 mg each morning, continue metformin 1000 mg twice daily and Avandia 2 mg each morning.  We will check hemoglobin A1c today as a baseline. We will follow up to determine appropriate titration of his insulin as well as addition of other doses during the day.

2.  His blood pressure is not optimally controlled at this time.  We will increase his lisinopril to 40 mg daily. He will continue his furosemide 60 mg daily and he will continue to titrate his Lasix dosing at the guidance of his primary care doctor.

3.  His last microalbumin to creatinine ratio and creatinine were normal.  Testing is up-to-date.

4.  The patient has an LDL that was above target this summer and Lipitor was initiated; however, he has not been on this long enough to see an effect. At his next visit, we will reevaluate his lipids to determine if his Lipitor needs titration.

5.  He is overdue for an eye exam and will contact Dr. Xuereb at Findlay him to have this done.

6.  We have made a referral to Dr. Liam Mcmahon for cardiology evaluation.  We have ordered an echocardiogram to be performed prior to this visit. We have also referred the patient to a number of possible PCPs in the OMC/CBC system. 



The patient was advised to return to the office in two months for follow up.

MS III Admission Note

Patient:  Eubanks, Larry
MRN:  7744323
DOB:    10/03/2080
Admit Date:  01/10/49
PCP:  Talbert, Nicholas	(783)508-2821
Sources:  Patient, wife, reliable; past medical records from Pennsylvania Hospital

CC:  chest pain

HPI:
Mr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with hypertension, mild diabetes mellitus type II, and gout who presents with 2 hours of burning chest pain prominent in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of the back.  

In addition to HTN and DM, Mr. Eubanks    cardiac risk factors include a family history of CAD (brother, sister) and prior history of mild, spontaneously resolving chest pain in early 2147.  He received a cardiac workup for the chest pain including baseline EKG, exercise tolerance test, and Myoview study.  Baseline EKG was unremarkable with normal sinus rhythm but the ETT was positive with inverted T waves, ST segment downsloping depressions in the anterolateral and inferior leads, and PVC   s in recovery.  The patient had no chest pain and good exercise capacity during the ETT, which was terminated after 9 minutes because of leg fatigue.  On the Myoview study, a small area of ischemia with possibly minimal scaring was noted in the inferior wall although wall motion was normal.  Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 62%.  A subsequent exercise echo was normal.  Baseline blood pressures at the time of the workup measured 160/68 with systolic pressures noted as high as 180.  His blood pressure has been since controlled on atenolol and was measured per patient account to be around 148/80 at his most recent visit to his PCP in August.  Hemoglobin A1C in 2147 was 6.2 and diabetes has been managed with only diet.   He was previously using daily aspirin but stopped in October 2148 for a dermatologic surgery and did not restart.  

Mr. Eubanks was in his usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission when he developed two episodes of low grade chest pain, once in the morning and once in the evening.  These episodes lasted only 1-2 minutes, and seemed to him to be related to his ongoing issues with gout.  The chest pain was not associated with shortness of breath and seemed to improve with indomethacin, which he typically takes for acute exacerbations of gout.  His course over the next two days was unremarkable and he went to bed comfortable the night prior to admission.  He was awakened near 3 am by 8/10 burning chest pain and pressure in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of his back but not to the neck or jaw.  Associated with the chest pain were chills and a feeling of increased heart rate although the patient denies shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or vomiting, headache, lightheadedness, fever, or vision changes.  The pain persisted for 2 hours without improvement or alleviating factors, prompting the patient to have his wife drive him to BBH ED from his Cheney home.  

Review of systems was positive for polyuria, increased thirst, mild non-productive cough, post-nasal drip, and intermittent mild diarrhea in past months.  The patient denies recent or past history of edema, GERD, claudication, clots, hemoptysis, hematemesis, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, wheezing, fatigue, appetite or weight changes, or night sweats.  

In the emergency department, the patient was given aspirin, lopressor, sublingual nitroglycerin, and 2L O2 by nasal cannula, and chest pain subsequently resolved.  EKG on presentation showed a poor baseline in sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy.  Subsequent EKG   s revealed continued PVC   s and PAC   s with biphasic T-waves in V4-5.  A chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia or acute CHF and showed no evidence of widened mediastinum.  CT scans with and without contrast which were negative for aortic dissection.  Cardiac enzymes x 2 sets were negative, but D-dimer was elevated at 816.  Stool sample was guiac positive, although CBC was stable with HCT 44.6.

CT (01/10/49):  With and without contrast.   No evidence of aortic dissection.  5 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, for which three month follow up chest CT is recommended to exclude malignancy.  Choelithiasis without cholecystitis.  Punctate calcification in the left kidney, without evidence for hydroureteralnephrosis, likely vascular, though renal calculus is possible.

Assessment:

Mr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with HTN, DM II, and gout, who presents with 2 hours of severe chest pain.  The differential for chest pain is broad and includes cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus, bronchitis, pleurisy, GERD/esophageal spasm, musculoskeletal/chest wall pain, and anxiety.  The sudden onset of severe chest pain, awaking him from sleep, raises the probability of an acute cardiac or pulmonary event such as MI, aortic dissection, or PE.  The patient has elevated D-Dimer but otherwise lacks physical exam findings (dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, signs of DVT) or CT/CTA imaging features consistent with pulmonary embolism.  The patient   s HTN is a risk factor for aortic dissection, but this diagnosis can be ruled out by negative CXR and CTA scans, which have 80     95% sensitivity.  In addition, he lacks a number of other clinical manifestations of dissection, including syncope, pulse deficits, and new murmur.  The distribution of the pain is anginal in distribution and is relieved by nitroglycerin + aspirin.  Moreover, the patient has had two similar but less severe attacks a few days ago, and has multiple cardiac risk factors.  This makes unstable angina or myocardial infarction the most likely diagnosis.  
EKG changes lacked ST segment elevation, although T-wave inversions were present in some leads.   The patient   s cardiac enzymes were negative from the ED x 2 sets with a third troponin negative on the floor.  The patient may have either a non-ST elevation MI or unstable angina.  The plan will be to continue monitoring closely for chest pain and EKG changes, with the next step likely to involve stress test or catheterization in the morning tomorrow.  Cardiology is following closely and has provided recommendations that are incorporated into the plan.  


Plan:  

1.  Chest pain
Telemetry, cardiac monitor
Troponin, CK, CK-MB q8h x 3
LDH on next draw
EKG if chest pain reemerges or in AM if no chest pain flare
ASA 325 mg po qd

NPO except MEDS after midnight; diabetic diet before midnight
Hold AM B-Blocker dose for exercise MIBI
Check in AM for fasting lipids, A1C 

2.  Ventricular Ectopy
Replete K, Mg to meet goals (K = 4.0, Mg = 2.0)

3.  GI bleed
Guiac positive stools
HCT stable 
AM labs:  CBC (HCT),Diff,Lytes,Glucose,BUN/Creatinine,Calcium,Phosphorus,Magnesium

4.  Diabetes
Stable, controlled by diet at home
Blood glucose fingersticks AC + HS
HgA1C in AM

Intern Addendum: I have interviewed and examined the pt with the medical student. In brief, the pt is a 67M w HTN gout and DM who woke up at 3am today with chest pressure and pain that radiated to both arms. He did feel slightly SOB but there was no N, V, diaphoresis or lightheadedness at this time. The episode lasted less than one minute and he felt better after he took indomethacin. Upon further questioning, he thinks he had two similar episodes last week. He has not had any DOE, PND, or LE edema. He does recall having chest pressure and chest pain in Feb 2147 when he had a    cardiac evaluation    at the Pennsylvania Hospital. He does not know the details of the workup. Of note the pt does not smoke, is not on ASA, and has several family members with CAD but no men <55 or women<65. He is on atenolol     but unsure of the dose. 
In the ED, he did have some chest pain but it was relieved after 1 nitro. HR was 85 and BP 135/82. He was given ASA and a BB. Initially, his EKG was read as normal but later the T waves became biphasic in leads V4-6. Repeat EKGs when he was chest pain free, showed flipped Ts in V4-6. There were no old EKGs available for comparison. He was seen by cardiology who recommended holding off on heparin bolus as he was found to be guaiac + (Hct 44). A dissection protocol CT was performed and was neg for dissection and for a central PE. (the ddimer was elevated). His first two sets of cardiac enzymes were negative and he was sent to the floor for further evaluation. On exam, he was in NAD and was CP free. Heart was RRR, lungs CTAB and he had no lower extremity edema. ASA and BB were cont. The third set of cardiac enzymes came back negative and the pt was scheduled for a stress test. However, the patient did experience some chest discomfort this morning and therefore cardiology felt it was best to take him to cath instead. This is planned for this morning. Please note this pt is allergic to Allopurinol.

Re:  Benitez, Wonda

     MRN: 89276954

 

Dear Usha:

 

I just had the pleasure of seeing Ms. Benitez for a follow up

cardiovascular examination.  She has been reasonably stable since

I saw her last in July.  She has had several episodes of chest

discomfort characterized as a tightness which has been quite

transient.  The frequency has been less than one time per month. 

The last occurred yesterday while she was walking in a shopping

mall.  She continued to walk and her symptom resolved.  She has

not had any associated shortness of breath or diaphoresis.  

 

She has had no symptoms of cardiovascular ischemia, denying

transient hemiparesis, hemiparesthesia, or amaurosis fugax.  She

denies claudication but does admit to back pain, bilateral hip

pain with walking.  She still notes paresthesias of both feet. 

She continues to be bothered by tinnitus as well as headaches.

 

Her current medical regimen includes losartan 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.,

nifedipine XL 60 mg p.o. q.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.,

atorvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.,

Synthroid ? 5 mcg five days per week and 10.5 mcg two days per

week, furosemide 20 mg p.o. q.d. p.r.n., quinine sulfate 324 mg

p.o. h.s. (for cramping), nitroglycerin p.r.n., Zoloft 15 mg p.o.

h.s., lorazepam 15 mg p.o. q.h.s., magnesium oxide 250 mg p.o.

q.d. and Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. p.r.n. 

 

On examination she appears well.  Weight is 142 pounds.  Blood

pressure is 140/60.  Heart rate is 50 and regular.  Neck veins

are 6 cm above the mid right atrium.  There are bilateral carotid

bruits.  Lungs are resonant to percussion and clear to

auscultation.  On cardiac exam the PMI is in the fifth

intercostal space at the midclavicular line.  There is a 1+ left

ventricular lift.  The first heart sound is normal.  The second 

 

Benitez, Wonda                                    MRN: 89276954

November 07, 2086              -2-

 

 

is split physiologically.  There is a grade 2/6 mid systolic

murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along

the left sternal border.  There is a fourth heart sound at the

apex.  Abdominal examination reveals no masses, no

hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are notable for 2+ bilateral

femoral pulses, palpable bilateral tibial artery bypass graft

pulses, absent bilateral popliteal pulses, 1+ right dorsalis

pedis, absent right posterior tibial and absent left pedal

pulses.

 

Her electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia with first degree

AV block and findings suggestive of a prior anterolateral

myocardial infarction.  There has been no diagnostic change since

July 18, 2086.

 

Carotid duplex ultrasound examination performed on October 31,

2086 showed a 55% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery

and a 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.  The

velocity of the right internal carotid artery and the subsequent

calculation of stenosis was less than it had been in February

2086.  

 

Graft scans obtained on October 31, 2086 demonstrated patent left

femoral-anterior tibial artery bypass graft with increased

velocities consistent with a greater than 75% stenosis at the mid

thigh level and this was increased from a study of August 06, 2086. 

The right femoral-dorsalis pedis arterial bypass graft was patent

with no evidence of significant stenoses.  

 

In summary, her problems relevant to this visit include:

 

1.  Coronary artery disease.  Status post coronary artery bypass

surgery.  LIMA to the LAD and SVGs to the diagonal and

posterolateral left ventricular branch.  She has occasional and

very transient episodes of angina.  I have suggested continuing

her current medical regimen.  As noted previously, I prefer to

manage her medically unless her symptoms worsen.  

 

2.  Carotid artery disease.  She is asymptomatic.  I recommend

periodic surveillance with carotid ultrasound. 

 

3.  Peripheral arterial disease.  Both grafts are patent but the

left femoral-anterior bypass graft appears by ultrasound to have

a significant stenosis.  I have asked her to discuss this finding

with you further.

4.  Hypercholesterolemia.  A lipid profile will be checked today. 

 

 

5.  Systolic murmur and query antibiotic prophylaxis for dental

procedures.  I am evaluating her murmurs, which were presumably

aortic sclerosis and mitral regurgitation, with an

echocardiogram.  

 

Sincerely,

Interim History:	

Comes to review her medical problems.

Has been feeling well. 



Home Blood Tests:  Records downloaded from meter with little detail and somewhat scattered BS.

B 	57-448

L	71-222

S	101-254

HS	163-399

No food records. No severe hypoglycemia. Has had a couple of nocturnal reactions. There are not enough data points to determine whether the Lantus dose is appropriate.



Retinopathy:	Saw Dr. Aragon over the spring. Has had extensive laser in the past, and had some last year OS after her surgery.

Nephropathy:	Her creatinine was stable at 1.3 in July

Neuropathy:	Feet are not bothering her. Sometimes has a peculiar diffuse tingling sensation precipitated by motion. 

Cardiac:	No chest pain. No unusual dyspnea on exertion. Has been able to exercise in the gym twice a week, walking steadily at a pretty fast pace for an hour. 

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Medications: no significant changes

Immunizations. Has not had flu shot yet this year. Had the second of hepatitis A series in L deltoid today.



Review of Systems: above

Breast: Saw Dr. Bruce a few weeks ago. Ultrasound showed what is being interpreted as a stable slightly enlarge intramammary lymph node. She find the lower part of the sternotomy scar to be very uncomfortable in most bras and wants to consider whether it can be improved.

Gyn: Overdue to see Yareli Kilgore; she will make the appointment.

Skin: Has noted some crusting lesions on her scalp.



Physical Exam:	

Looks well. In very good spirits. Jake is with her.

BP:   134/80		P:   72	Seated

BP:   116/76		P:   76	Standing

Wt:   168 without shoes, stable

HEENT:	Anicteric. 

Carotids:	Normal pulses, without bruits

Chest:	Clear to percussion and auscultation

	There is a small keloid at the inferior portion of the median sternotomy scar

Heart:	Normal S1; physiologic S2.  No gallops.  2/6 systolic ejection murmur

Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness. No palpable AAA. 

Extremities:	No edema.        DP 1+,=.  PT 1+,=.  No open areas of feet. Has several toe deformities, dystrophic nails and probable onychomycosis.

Skin:	Crusting lesion on scalp



Impressions and Plan:	

Hard to assess control. She is reluctant to keep hand records.

Will try to add an ACE inhibitor again. Start captopril 6.25 mg bid and increase the 12.5 mg bid if tolerated. Check BP at home.

She would like to consider treatment for onychomycosis. Would suggest that Dr. Xie send a paring for fungal culture before we consider it. Also, LFTs were slightly abnormal in July and will need to be repeated. Finally, would have to check medication incompatibilities before proceeding.

Refer to Dr. xia for consideration of modification of her sternotomy scar. Warned her that he may not feel that it is a good idea either on pure surgical grounds on because of her immunosuppression, but it is worth asking his opinion.

Refer to Dr. Keeler for evaluation of scalp lesions.

Flu shot R deltoid with usual preamble. Aventis Fluzone Lot L5317YR. Exp. 7/10/76.

A1c, SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, Bili T/D, Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine 

Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine again in 1 month if she is taking captopril at that time.

CXR:	

New mild interstitial pulmonary edema.



EKG:	Nl sinus rhythm, L axis deviation, nl intervals, T wave inversions I, aVL, T wave flattening V3-V6, old inferior infarct.



Echo 11/07 - There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  There are no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities.  Theestimated ejection fraction is 73 %.



___________________________________________



Impression: Pt. is a 59 y.o. male with DLBCL dx'ed 11/07 s/p CHOP-R, HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and anemia who p/w acute onset SOB in the setting of a BP = 178/108 likely 2/2 flash pulmonary edema.





Plan: 

CHF - pt.'s PE resolved s/p 20 mg IV lasix, administration of lopressor, and NTG. He showed no signs of volume overload during the physical exam. Chest CT showed no acute hemorrhage, PTX, or lymphangitic spread (preliminary read). Follow-up official CT read. No contrast was given, therefore, acute SOB could not be secondary to contrast allergy. This pt.'s salty diet and uncontrolled HTN most likely led to the acute decompensation. No evidence of infection. Pt. will receive an Echo to evaluate for possible worsening LVEF s/p antrhacycline chemo vs. diastolic dysfunction with LV hypertrophy. F/U BNP. Will re-dose lasix only if necessitated by clinical signs of volume overload.

Angina - This pt. has EKG changes and pain that is possibly cardiogenic in origin. Will obtain serial enzymes to r/o MI. Begin ASA, increase lopressor to 50 TID, captopril instead of lisinopril for easier titration of BPs, 2LO2 via nasal canula. Consider stress test before d/c.

Prophylaxis - fragmin 5000 SC QD. SOB resolved after lasix + lopressor. Unlikely PE in this setting but pt. is hypercoagulable given malignancy. Low threshold for CT PE protocol.

GERD-Omeprazole.

Onc - Will check uric acid and LDH to eval. for possible TLS. Unlikely given normal electrolytes and good renal function. CT shows no lymphangitic spread but must f/u official read in the AM.

SICU visit (Hamilton 04239)

8/26/05 11 45 pm


74 yo male with a history of CAD, PVD s/p right femoral to above knee popliteal bypass with PTFE (5/00) and recent admission for RLE angioplasty X 22 who presents with R foot rest pain and discoloration and underwent fem pop bypass graft. The case was complicated by large blood loss anemia and hypotension.  In the PACU the patient continued to be hypotensive and have low uop. We placed a central line (starting CVP was 0) and continued resuscitation. The patient developed ST changes and also had acute on chronic renal failure (RIFLE F). WE transfused and transferred him to the ICU.  We discussed this at length with the surgical service as well as cardiology.
 
I examined the patient reviewed the chart and discussed the case. I agree with history and exam as outlined in residents note
 
Issues:
Cardiac ischemia:  Ischemia was mostly due to hypotension and low HGB as well as tachycardia .  Will give aspirin and lower HR to 70's with Beta blockers. Contue statin.  Willt ransfuse to HGB around 10 and continue to check troponins
 
Decreased myocardial function: he has low central venous saturation and increased lactate . Will give fluids and transfuse the patient.  Will get echo in am. If his central venous sat  and lactate does not signficantly improve with these measures would stay away from inotropes for now given his rate related ischemia
 
Acute blood-loss naemia: will transfuse to 
 
Metabolic acidosis: the patetin has signifcant metabolic acidosis. We will for now give volume. 
 
Acute renal failure: He has significantly decreaed uop. We are sending  urine lytes and casts. Will increase filling pressures. For now would not use furosemide given low central filling pressures.

ZASTROW, IRENE

12/07/2085


DATE OF ADMISSION:  12/06/2085.

This 66-year-old woman phoned my office complaining of exertional chest discomfort.  We instructed her to presented to the Emergency Department at Davis Monthan Hospital.  She had experienced multiple episodes of chest pressure with exertion lasting 5-10 minutes and radiating to her left axilla.

On 10/30/2085, she suffered non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction in Pennsylvania and was managed with percutaneous coronary intervention.

Chest discomfort recurred and on 11/03/2085, she was recatheterized at Davis Monthan Hospital where her mid LAD stent was expanded.

She has had worsening substernal chest discomfort over the past two to three days.  Her discomfort is relieved with nitroglycerin.  Overnight, she had on and off chest discomfort with anterior T-wave lability.  She was placed on intravenous heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin.

She suffered pulmonary embolism in 2074.   That is when I first met her.  She has gastroesophageal reflux disease.

She is married; her husband works at 24 Hour Fitness as a personal trainer in the weight room.  She does not smoke cigarettes.  She has four children.

Home medications include aspirin 325 mg daily, atenolol 25 mg daily, Lipitor 80 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, insulin, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.

The review of systems is negative other than the above.

On physical examination, she appears well.  Afebrile, blood pressure 126/82 mmHg, heart rate 72 and regular, and respiratory rate 13 per minute.  HEENT is normal.  The neck veins are not distended.  The chest is clear.  On cardiac examination, she has a regular rhythm with a normal S1, single S2, and no murmur, rub, or gallop.  Abdomen has no masses or hepatomegaly.  The legs have no clubbing or cyanosis, but there is right leg greater than left leg edema.  The skin has no rash.

My assessment is that Irene Zastrow has ""small vessel"" coronary artery disease in addition to epicardial coronary artery disease.  We will intensify her medical regimen by prescribing higher doses of beta blockade and by initiating a long-acting nitrate.  We will also repeat the chest CT scan to make sure she has not suffered from recurrent pulmonary embolism.

I discussed this plan with her, her husband, and the medical house staff.

SUBJECTIVE: The patient returns.  She has had three
operations on her back, finally ending with a fusion of
L2-L3 and a laminectomy in that area for recurrent disk
disease  at L2-L3.  She still is having severe pain going
down her right leg and anterior knee which is unchanged or
perhaps somewhat better.  She sees Dr. Herring with
regularity.  She has seen Dr. Oscar Riggs.  She has
nothing wrong with her hips and she has had multiple CT
scans showing the numerous operations and fusion.  

MEDICATIONS:  
1.  Lipitor 20 mg q.d. 
2.  Glynase 1.5 mg b.i.d. 
3.  Trandate 100 mg q.d.  
4.  Tegretol 300 mg in a.m., 200 mg in the p.m.  
5.  Premarin 0.625 mg 30 days a month.  
6.  Provera 5 mg 12 days a month.
7.  Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg q.d. 
8.  Calcium 1200 mg q.d. 

She is in physiotherapy presently. She is not smoking nor
drinking.  She has been eating and has gained considerable
weight.

She has no cardiopulmonary, GI or GU complaints.  She is to
see Dr. Bruce Godfrey's replacement in August and to get a
mammogram at that time.  Hopefully, she will be able to lie
on the table when that occurs.  She is now able to drive a
car, but walks with a cane and cannot lie down with any
degree of ease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She weighs 192 lbs stripped and her
blood pressure is 160/90 in the left arm standing, pulse is
72 and regular.  She appears as a well developed, overweight
white female in pain, having to hold on while standing,
easily weeping, but pleasant.  There is no icterus, cyanosis
or edema.  The eyes reveal 2+ arcus.  Pupils are round,
reactive and equal.  Nose and throat examination is
unremarkable.  Neck veins are flat.  Carotids are 2+ and
equal and without bruit.  Thyroid small and smooth.  Lungs
are clear to P&A. The heart is not enlarged.  There is a
regular sinus rhythm and no significant murmurs.  S1 and S2
are normal.  Liver and spleen cannot be felt.  She has good
peripheral pulses.

IMPRESSION:  
1.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.  She has had an eye exam at
Mitchel Memorial Hospital this past year, but her diabetes is poorly
controlled as her blood sugars have been in the 150-200
range.  I have told her to increase her Glynase to 3 mg
twice a day until she is able to diet.
2.  L2-L3 disk with fusion. 
3.  Mild hypertension, on no medication.  Will not start any
until she loses weight.

Russell, Donna
10418061

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Russell returns for further evaluation.  
She has been doing very well.  She has been exercising and has lost from 
200 to 170 pounds.  She is feeling very well.

Notably, Dr. Lu sent her for a follow-up ETT.  He did not find the 
first ETT acceptable.  The second ETT was grossly positive.  As a result 
of this, I think it is reasonable for us in addition to having her on 
atenolol to stop the hydrochlorothiazide, put her on ramipril and a 
nitrate.  She is having once every two weeks feeling a slight twinge of 
pain that she was having before when she went up steps.

She did have hyperlipidemia.  We have put her on Lipitor, which has 
provided some control.  However, her HCL is still 36 and LDL 118, which 
is not an excellent ratio.  Nonetheless, her CK has been within normal 
limits.

She also has right shoulder lipoma.  This has become apparent since she 
lost so much weight.  She wanted to see someone in follow up and I have 
recommended Dr. Dawson.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her weight is 170 pounds, blood pressure is 
120/64, respiratory rate is 20, and pulse is 64.  Neck is supple.  There

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.	CAD.  We will start her on ramipril and long acting nitrate.  I also 
gave her nitroglycerine.  We will stop her hydrochlorothiazide but 
continue her atenolol.  She is also on one aspirin a day along with 
Premarin and Synthroid.
2.	Weight loss.  She will continue to exercise.  I suspect she is going 
to lose more weight.  This is excellent.
3.	Coronary artery disease.  Dr. Lu will be deciding when to do a 
cardiac catheterization.  It is his opinion, and I must concur that 
this is an appropriate next step with Ms. Russell.  She is going to 
delay her usual trip to Rhode Island until we can get final assessment 
done on this variety of medical issues.

ECG:  NSR, nil acute, unchanged from previous 05/05/64    

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
44M with ESRD on HD presents with N/V.  His symptoms appear to be resolving and this may represent a viral gastroenteritis, as his cardiac enzymes are negative and sugars have been well-controlled since presentation to ED.  He may have an element of diabetic gastroparesis given his medication list.  We will add amylase and lipase to his bloodwork to r/o pancreatitis.  Consider AXR to r/o constipation (normally on lactulose).

Plan:
1.  HD today as per usual schedule and prescription.  Hold Epo given Hct elevated.
2.  Will draw blood Cx x 2, iron studies, 25OH Vitamin D, PTH in HD.
3.  Start Nephrocaps.
4.  CAD risk:  Start ASA 81mg qd.
5.  Polypharmacy:  On multiple antihypertensives at different doses.  Would d/c enalapril and losartan.  Use only lisinopril daily (titrate up as needed), but ask patient to take meds after dialysis on dialysis days.
6.  Social work to see (already informed).

Patient Name: FALLON, SHARON;  MRN: 1703242
Dictated on: 11/11/2074 by PATRICIA DRAKE, N.P., PH.D. 

 
HISTORY:  Mrs. Fallon returns to clinic for evaluation and management of a right posterior ankle ulceration.  Since her last visit to the clinic, she was evaluated by Dr. Frederick Archer who admitted her for a diagnostic angiogram, which revealed that she had adequate perfusion to the ankle level 
to heal the ulceration.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, Mrs. Fallon has ruborous discoloration of the distal half of her bilateral lower extremity with scattered vesicles on the anterior surface of her left lower extremity.  The 
ulceration is on the posterior aspect of the right ankle.  It measured 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm.  The tissue is moist yellow subcutaneous tissue, the margin is clear.  In the setting of ruborous discoloration, it appears that Mrs. Fallon may have an acute flare of her chronic lipodermatosclerosis.   
PLAN:  Daily wound care per the following protocol; 1.  Normal saline irrigation 30 cc x 3.  A thin layer of 50% Diprolene ointment 0.05% with Bactroban cream to the wound bed and the wide periwound margin.  Primary dressing will be Telfa covered with rolled gauze.  Mrs. Fallon will return to clinic in 2 weeks unless the wound bed is closed and then she will follow up with Dr. Archer on Tuesday, November 26th.

                                                         Date of Visit: 9/10/2064



Vascular Surgery Consult Note:



I am asked to examine Mr. Isenberg and comment on recent CT findings of a intraluminal defect in the right subclavian artery.



PMH / PSH:

1.	CAD - S/p  2-V CABG off pump in 4/64

2.	CHF- EF 38%, mild MR, diffusely hypokinetic LV w/ apical aneurysm, RVSP 46mmHg, upper 

segment septal hypertrophy w/o evidence of obstruction on TTE on 3/24/64

3.	HTN

4.	Hyperlipidemia

5.	DMII

6.	CRI- Baseline Pcr is between 1.6-1.8



Medications: 

Plavix 75 mg qd

Aspirin 325 mg qd

Lipitor 80 mg qd

Lisinopril 2.5 mg qd

Atenolol 25 mg qd

Fluoxetine 10 mg qd

 	 	 	 	

Allergies: NKDA





Mr Isenberg is a 82 yo gentleman one week out from attempted placement of right subclavian pacemaker- complicated by brief arterial puncture, prompt removal of the arterial catheter and successful compression. Duplex ultrasonography after compression showed no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm. A CTA done yesterday to evaluate his thyroid was  read as: 



"" Hematoma around right subclavian artery.  Narrowing of the artery. Apparent filling defect, most likely artifactual.  If thrombus is of clinical concern, upper extremity ultrasound may be obtained.""



On physical examination, he has mild non expansile hematoma of the right chest wall. His right hand is warm and well perfused, with 1+ radial and brachial pulses. There are no thrills or bruits.



My review of arterial components of the CT show the following:

1). Hematoma- to be expected

2). Diffuse arterial calcifications- obscures the ability to read what is or is not in the lumen.

3). Venous contrast bolus delivered on the right side- obscures our ability to discern the anatomy in the area of the subclavian artery.

4). Contrast bolus inadequate to comment on arterial anatomy.



Based on his clinical exam, and the fact that he is on an anticoagulant, a follow up subclavian artery ultrasound examination is in order. This test should be geared towards determining whether there is any evidence of a pseudoaneurysm. If there is an intraarterial filling defect, I would not pursue it. He is anticoagulated and his arm is viable. There are no stigmata of atheroemboli.

Patient Name: LILLY, LARRY;  MRN: 2155941
Dictated on: 11/20/2071 by ANDRE-ISRAEL SANTIAGO, M.D. 

 
DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral, right greater than left, carpal tunnel syndrome.  
 
HISTORY:  This is a first office visit for this 77-year-old, right-hand-dominant, founder of Bed Bath and Beyond, who comes for evaluation of right greater than left hand and wrist pain.  The patient reports having a longstanding history of greater than four months of worsening pain, paresthesias, and ""numbness"" on the right worse than left hand.  This is worse at night and does occasionally wake him up from sleep.  Also bothers him during prolonged activity.  He also reports recently over the past few months noting difficulty with the key pinch, grasp, and fine motor function.  Previous evaluation consisted of cervical spine MRI as well as EMG nerve conduction studies demonstrating findings significant for severe compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of wrist.  He now comes for evaluation for potential carpal tunnel surgery release.   
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Glucose intolerance, history of previous CVA, status post CABG, hypertension, GER.   
MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, Zocor, Ecotrin, Effexor, and Nexium.  
 
ALLERGIES:  None.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, he is very pleasant, well appearing in no apparent distress.  
Examination of the right hand demonstrates marked thenar atrophy.  There is no active abductor pollicis brevis and 
very weak opponens.  He has a positive Tinel's, positive Phalen's, and positive median nerve compression test at the wrist.  His interossei and extensors are full.  Sensation is intact throughout.  
 
EMG studies from 11/09/2071, performed here at Folsom Convalescent Hospital, significant for right worse than left median nerve compression neuropathy at the wrists.   
IMPRESSION:  The patient is seen and examined with Dr. Santiago.  At this time, we feel that Larry has indeed a significant, right worse than left, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.  Given the amount of weakness and thenar wasting, he has difficulty with abductor pollicis, we have recommended proceeding with both carpal tunnel release as well as 
possible FTS of ring finger to thumb tendon transfer.  We discussed with Larry the risks and benefits of this procedure and he is in agreement of the plan.  We will try to schedule him to proceed with surgery at some point in the near future.  We filled out both history and physical, as well as a surgical consent form today in the office.

o'clock, associated with nausea, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, 
and generalized weakness.  He states the discomfort was a 
substernal tightness without radiation.  At the present time he 
states the pain is approximately 4/10 in intensity.  Of note, the 
patient had a stress test done on December 6, 2081, standard Bruce, 
for which he exercised 7 minutes, 30 seconds and stopped secondary 
to fatigue.  He went 74 percent of predicted and developed no 
symptoms.  The test revealed no evidence of ischemia. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As noted above. 
MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, amoxicillin, aspirin, insulin, 
nitroglycerin p.r.n., Claritin, lisinopril, and Zocor. 
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. 
SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient denies smoking. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Well-developed, well-nourished, 
pleasant male in no acute distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97, 
blood pressure 108/62, pulse 80, respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 
97 percent on room air.  HEENT:  Mucous membranes were moist 
without lesions.  NECK:  Supple without jugular venous distension.

platelets 323,000.  CPK was 1213, MB 10.5.  SMA-7 was within normal 
limits.  Cardiac troponin was 0.04.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm 
with nonspecific T-wave changes.  There was a flipped T-wave in 
leads 1 and aVL, which is unchanged compared with prior tracing 
dated December 6, 2081. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was treated in the 
emergency department with O2, two liters via nasal cannula, 
nitroglycerin 1/150 sublingual times three, Lopressor 25 mg p.o., 
and aspirin 325 mg p.o.  The patient became pain-free and remained 
hemodynamically stable. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain, rule out myocardial infarction. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient will 
be admitted to the medical service for further evaluation and 
management, including usual rule out myocardial infarction 
protocol.  He was admitted in stable condition.

Present Illness:  

Asked to see this 66 year old man who was transferred to LEPROSARIUM for care of an ischemic R foot. He has had a series of illness over the spring, beginning with a hospitalization for pneumonia in June. He later developed what was thought to be a splenic subcapsular hematoma (on Coumadin for chronic atrial fibrillation) and then subsequently developed LUQ pain and was found to have a splenic abscess that was drained. In the course of this illness, he also developed an ischemic R foot and was found (at what stage?) to have a popliteal aneurysm. 



At the time of his admission, he was found to have diabetes. He has been treated with Lantus insulin, most recently 15 Units at bedtime, on which regimen he has had consistent overnight drops, often to hypoglycemic levels. He reports that he weighed about 200 pounds before this illness but has lost about 50 pounds.

RE:  Roberta Vincent
     MR #380-18-32-2
 
Dear Dr. Long:
 
Thank you for referring Ms. Roberta Vincent to the Renal Services Clinic.  I had the pleasure of seeing her on November 16,
2092.  Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.
 
Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old mother of eight with chronic renal
failure of unknown etiology.  She is six years status post
hysterectomy for endometriosis during which an occult
leiomyosarcoma was discovered.  She has an extensive history of
hidradenitis, obesity, and hypertension.  She had one stillborn
infant, one premature infant, and three spontaneous abortions. 
SFOC records are unavailable at this time.
 
Her medications include Premarin 0.625 qd, Diltiazem 240 qd,
furosemide 40 mg qd, Mevacor 20 mg qd, Calcitriol 0.25 mcg qd,
Niferex 300 mg qd, Vitamin E 400 units qd, fish oil qd, and Keflex
250 mg qid.
 
On physical examination Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old woman in no
distress.  Her weight is 101.5 kilograms, or 223 lbs.  Temperature
is normal.  Pulse is 88 beats per minute.  Blood pressure is
178/96.  There is striking hirsutism and moon facies.  There is a
buffalo hump.  The lungs show scattered wheezing.  Cardiovascular
exam is normal.  There are discolorations of the skin across the
neck, upper extremities, and trunk which are hyperpigmented but not
raised.  The abdomen is obese without palpable masses.  There is a
ventral hernia deep in the lower part of the abdomen.  The
extremities show trace edema.  There are several areas of
superficial petechiae.
 
In summary, this 56-year-old woman has chronic renal failure of
unclear etiology.  She does report an episode of lower extremity
swelling in association with an episode of hidradenitis.  ThisRoberta Vincent
MR #380-18-32-2               -2-            November 16, 2092
 
 
raises the possibility of a post-infectious glomerulonephritis now
in a chronic phase.  Other diagnostic possibilities include other
forms of chronic glomerulonephritis including systemic lupus
erythematosus given the history of spontaneous abortions. 
Nevertheless, I agree that kidney biopsy is not indicated at this
time given the advanced nature of her disease and the increased
risk due to her body habitus.
 
I discussed several options in renal replacement therapy with Ms.
Vincent. Although she has no medical conditions which would
preclude living-related or cadaveric kidney transplantation, her
obesity and glucose intolerance along with the history of
hidradenitis make transplantation a less attractive option.  I have
encouraged Ms. Vincent to attempt a gradual weight loss program in
order to improve her fitness prior to either dialysis or
transplantation.  Nevertheless, her appearance is quite reminiscent
of Cushing's disease, and this should be worked up if it has not
been performed previously.
 
I have arranged an iothalamate GFR to more closely approximate her
kidney function and a follow-up appointment in two months' time to
meet with Helen Uren and consider creation of a native AV
fistula or placement of a graft.
 
Thank you once again for your kind referral.
 
Respectfully,

Russell, Donna

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Russell is returning for follow 
up.  She has had couple of further episodes of this peculiar 
sensation in which her arm feels like it goes dead and then she 
gets some pressure in her chest.  She gets a slight shortness of 
breath.  It lasts 30 seconds.  She gets as many as three or four 
a day.  The frequency has, however, decreased and she is feeling 
better and better, as she begins to lose some weight.  I think 
weight loss is going to be critical.  She also is less fatigued 
as she begins to lose weight.

Her hypertension has been under better control.  
Hydrochlorothiazide seems to be helping quite a bit in addition 
to the atenolol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 146/86.  Weight has gone 
from 200 to 196 pounds.  Respiratory rate is 20.  Pulse is 64.  
Neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  Chest is clear to 
percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam is regularly regular 
with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  
There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are clear of 
cyanosis, clubbing and edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrolytes are within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
1.	Hypertension.  Relatively well controlled on 
hydrochlorothiazide plus atenolol.
2.	Weight.  Now began to lose some weight and feeling much 
better as a result of it.
3.	Peculiar chest pressure.  I do not think she has coronary 
artery disease given the exercise test.  In light of this, 
we will try to control her blood pressure and get her to 
lose some weight.  Hopefully, this will help with the 
resolution of her symptoms.

MASSEY,RAMONA   446-90-33-6                       VISIT DATE: 10/07/69
TIME OF DICTATION:  1 p.m. 
PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 
patient is a 63-year-old female who presents to the Zollman Community Clinic Emergency Department from home after the patient 
was found down by her daughter inside her home for an unspecified 
amount of time.  The paramedics and police were called the scene. 
The police were able to force open the door of the home.  The 
patient was found unconscious on the floor, having a generalized 
tonic clonic seizure.  The patient was intubated and given 4 mg of 
Ativan prior to arrival in the Emergency Department with the 
paramedics.  On arrival in the Emergency Department, the patient 
was noted to be comatose, intubated, and clearly in acute distress. 
The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus.  She has had a 
seizure in the past, apparently secondary to hypoglycemia.  She 
also has a history of high blood pressure.  She is on diltiazem, 
lisinopril, and medications for hypercholesterolemia. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 100.6 degrees F., her 
pulse 150, her respiratory rate 12, her blood pressure on arrival 
205/90, and her O2 saturation is 98%.  On physical examination, the 
HEENT examination reveals a normocephalic head with no evidence of 
trauma on examination.  The pupils are equal and round, weakly 
reactive to light.  The pupils are 2 mm.  The fundi cannot be 
visualized.  The neck is supple.  There are no step-offs noted. 
The chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The heart has 
normal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4, and no murmur.  The abdomen is 
protuberant, but soft and non-tender, without guarding, rebound, 
masses, or organomegaly.  The extremities are grossly within normal 
limits.  Grossly, there is no posturing; there are no Babinskis; 
the reflexes are about 1+ bilaterally. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The head CT is noted to be negative.  The 
EKG reveals ST elevations in III and possibly aVF.  The heart rate 
is approximately 130.  The chest x-ray shows proper tube placement. 
The troponin I is 2.2, and is in the process of being repeated. 
The glucose is 174, the BUN 57, the creatinine 5.8, the sodium 137, 
the potassium 5.3, the chloride 101, the CO2 18.  The CK is noted 
to be 920, and the CK-MB is 2.6%.  The toxicology screen is 
negative.  The troponin I again is 2.2.  The urine toxicology is 
also noted to be negative.  The white count is 14, the hemoglobin 
11, the hematocrit 36, and the platelet count 350.  The urinalysis 
shows 3+ blood.  There are only 1-3 WBCs in the urine. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:   The plan is to admit the patient 
to the Intensive Care Unit for further work-up and evaluation.  An 
LP will be done in the Emergency Department, and following the LP, 
the patient will be sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  The diagnostic impression in the Emergency 
Department is seizure and coma of undetermined etiology. 
DISPOSITION (including condition on discharge):  The patient will 
be admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit following her lumbar 
puncture.

RE:  I had the pleasure of seeing Verna Cantu in consultation today for management of coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis.

Dear Dr. Levon Nichols,

  She is a very pleasant 60 year old female with cardiovascular risk factors of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, and prior tobacco abuse. She has no prior history of myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, or congestive heart failure. About 15 years ago she underwent an ETT for evaluation of exertional lightheadedness which by her reports was unremarkable. 
She has an extensive vascular history s/p right popliteal PTA/Stent and left common femoral endarterectomy for which she has been receiving regular care from Dr. Nichols. She has a history of mixed connective tissue disease with Raynaud's for which she has been followed by Dr. Lucille Jackson. 

She reports that for the past year she has had dyspnea on exertion which typically manifests itself when she is trying to climb the 2.5 flights of stairs that she has at home. She feels shortness of breath requiring her to stop when she gets to the top. She denies exertional chest pain or lightheadedness. She denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or edema. She denies lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations, or syncope. Currently she reports no symptoms of claudication. No regular exercise. A couple of times a day. Bowls on Sunday night with no shortness of breath. She has also been noted to have a systolic murmur on previous exams. An echocardiogram in 2094 revealed aortic valve leaflet thickening but did not report significant aortic stenosis, though this was a technically difficult study by report. 

For evaluation of these symptoms she underwent an ETT-MIBI which was notable for poor exercise capacity, drop in blood pressure, exercise induced LBBB, and perfusion abnormality suggesting distal LAD territory ischemia. 



	Past medical history:
   1. Diabetes Mellitus: On oral medications for 7 years +Retinopathy both eyes ~ 7 yrs ago, no nephropathy. +neuropathy

A/P:  77M w/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction managed with chronic indwelling stents, the etiology which is unclear, now admitted w/ ARF, hyperkalemia and a presumed UTI.  His ureteral stents were last changed 12/94, but he has never obtained a diagnosis for his B ureteral obstruction; in 12/94, left RPG showed hydroureter to UVJ and on the right a distal ureteral stricture was noted at the UVJ. Difficult management issue since fails to follow-up and is normally cared for during acute episode admissions. We recommend:

F/U UCx and continue empiric treatment; managed by ID in the past and their services may be helpful if he doesn&#8217;t respond at present.  
Continue hydration and treatment for hyperkalemia/ARF; may benefit from renal consult given h/o RTA
F/U RUS to assess for recurrent hydronephrosis. Left kidney not well visualized at last US.  Depending on the results of this study, consider ureteral stent change vs. staged removal.  Needs to be medically optimized prior to undergoing anaesthesia.

Internal Medicine

Davis Monthan Hospital

Naples, OK  73257



Dear Iva:



Irene Zastrow, 66 years old, returned for followup of coronary artery disease and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction that she suffered in Pennsylvania on 10/29/2085.  At that time, she had a drug-eluting stent placed in her left anterior descending coronary artery.  On 11/03/2085, she had repeat percutaneous coronary intervention because of persistent chest pain and required an additional inflation and reexpansion of the drug-eluting stent.  On 12/07/2085, she had repeated cardiac catheterization because of chest pain but no additional percutaneous coronary intervention was required.



She feels that she is having less chest discomfort as we have ""ramped up"" her cardiac medications.  She has no shortness of breath.  She does get occasional abdominal pulsations.  She does get epigastric discomfort.



Current medications include ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, aspirin 325 mg once daily, Plavix 75 mg once daily, isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg once daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, and insulin.



The review of systems is negative other than the above.



On physical examination, she appears well.  Weight 165 pounds, blood pressure 109/73 mmHg, heart rate 77 and regular, respiratory rate 14.  HEENT:  Normal.  The neck veins are not distended.  The chest is clear.  On cardiac examination, she has a regular rhythm with a normal S1, single S2, and no murmur, rub, or gallop.  Abdomen has no masses or hepatomegaly.  The legs have no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  The skin has no rash.



Irene Zastrow is improving from the clinical cardiovascular view point.



I will obtain an exercise treadmill test using the standard Bruce protocol to obtain additional objective data.



Although theoretically she should not have acid secretion due to pernicious anemia, I do suspect she has acid reflux, and I am reinstituting today Prilosec 20 mg twice daily.



I am prescribing physical therapy for her ""stiff neck.""



I am ordering an abdominal ultrasound to exclude abdominal aortic aneurysm due to her complaint of episodic abdominal severe pulsations.



I reassured her and told her she is clinically improving.  I will plan to see her again in about four months.



Best personal regards.



Sincerely yours,

Pt does not need periop beta blockade from a risk perspective, but should continue on home beta blockade given her HTN and now new AF.2. new AF: pt is now in new AF/RVR, asymptomatic, after missing her AM atenolol. She is getting 5mg IV lopressor plus 25 mg po lopressor in the ED, hopefully this will provide some rate control. She should continue on BB.- try 37.5 mg lopressor q8h; hold for HR &lt;60, SBP &lt;100- it is possible that arrhythmia may precipitate falls. She may benefit from a holter monitor as an outpatient, to see whether she is frequently in AF, or whether this was precipitated by illness and missing BB (more likely).- keep pt on tele while in house3. Hx NMS/serotonin syndrome: pt carries a dx of NMS from prior med use the last time she was hospitalized for hip surgery (see CAS notes 11/16/77). However, pt is elderly and with hx of dementia, is at risk for postop dementia. Given this, avoid anti-dopaminergic meds like haldol, seroquel, zydis/zyprexa, reglan. This pt tolerates small doses of benzo as a home med, therefore pt can try:- home klonopin 0.25mg po bid standing- ativan 0.5 mg q6h prn agitation- monitor for signs of NMS: mental status changes with muscle rigidity, fever, autonomic instability. Check CK if this happens and page med consult 06885 if any concerns.Thank you for this consult. We will follow with you.__________________________________Peggy Ellis, PGY-2 Pager #75412

-check iron levels

-would obtain MRA of mesenteric  vessels to look for mesenteric ischemia (PVD, HTN, CAD, etc).

-hold off on colonoscopy for now given risk for perforation.

-cycle cardiac markers, continue antiHTN and anti-ischemic regimen.

-consult GI and cardiology if clinical conditions worsen.

RE:  BENITEZ, Wonda

MRN: 892-76-95-4

 

Dear Usha:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing one of your patients, Ms. Benitez, in

my Cardiovascular Clinic today for follow-up status post coronary

artery bypass surgery.  As you know, Ms. Benitez has been having a

terrible past month with increasing episodes of substernal chest

discomfort.  One episode occurred during Ramadan when she was

fasting and another occurred while she was in a restaurant.  Both of

these episodes were relieved with sublingual nitroglycerine.  I

am concerned about her discomfort because of an earlier

Persantine MIBI study showing anteroapical redistribution on her

test and the fact that it was relieved by nitroglycerine. 

Currently she denies any PND, orthopnea or chest discomfort.  She

continues to have back and bilateral hip pain and has been taking

corticosteroid shots for that.

 

On physical examination, she is an anxious, concerned, elderly

woman.  Blood pressure is 160/70 in the left arm.  Jugular venous

pulse is not observed.  She has bilateral carotid bruits.  Chest

exam is clear.  Cardiac exam shows an S4 gallop, a normal S1, a

physiologically split S2 and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left

sternal border.  Abdominal exam is benign.  Peripheral exam shows

trace pedal edema.

 

EKG shows sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute. 

There are Q waves in V1 through V4, consistent with an old

anterolateral MI.  The tracing was otherwise unchanged compared

with previous tracings.

RE:  BENITEZ, Wonda

MRN: 892-76-95-4              - 2 -          November 01, 2085

 

 

IMPRESSION:  I think we should schedule Ms. Benitez for a

Persantine thallium test as soon as possible.  If she can

exercise on this test, that would be even better. When the

results are back, I will get back you regarding further

recommendations.  My hope is that we will not have to

revascularize her again.  If we do, I am hoping to do so with

potential angioplasty and stenting.  In the meantime, I have

switched her from Zocor 40 mg to Lipitor 40 mg a day in the hopes

of targeting her LDL cholesterol to the new guidelines of 100. 

Her previous LDL cholesterol was 111.  I also suggested to her in

the meantime to cut down on her physical activities until we know

the results of the thallium test and also to forgo one episode of

her steroid injection for her back.

 

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns

regarding this patient.  Again, thank you for referring her to

our clinic.

 

With warm regards,

OFFICE VISIT:  10/14/84



This 28-year-old young woman, status post two failed renal transplants, re-presents for evaluation.  She is less depressed, more upbeat.  Now a year since her father's death (? drug overdose).



She is on tapering prednisone after her severe rejection for noncompliance. She has multiple access problems, history of seizures, and severe hyperparathyroidism.  



Medications:  Her meds include Prednisone 2 mg in the a.m., Nephrocaps, Prilosec 20 q.d., Midodrine 5 mg only before dialysis, Diltanin 400 mg b.i.d., Tegretol 250 b.i.d., Renagel 4 caps at breafast, lunch, dinner, 3 capsules with snacks plus 2 tablespoons Alternagel, Doxepin 50 q.h.s., Coumadin 5 mg, Xanax 4-5 tablets of 0.5 q.d., Celexa 20.



Allergies:  She has allergies to Cipro, Demerol, penicillin, and gets red man syndrome from Vanco if given rapidly.  



She has seasonal allergies and takes Zyrtec 10 mg, Flonase 2 sprays each nostril, Albuterol 2 puffs 4x a day as needed, and Advair 2 puffs as needed.



Social History:  She is taking 1 course at computer school.



Physical Examination: Her blood pressure was 170/90 - this is much higher for her.  She has conjunctival injection, which is her acute red eye of uremia.  Neck is supple.  Carotid upstroke is normal.  Thyroid is not enlarged.  Chest is clear. She is chronically ill appearing.  She has an S4, no S3.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  Bowel sounds are normal.  She has a graft in her leg.  She as 1+ to 2+ edema. She has been gaining 4 kg in the interdialytic period.



Impression:  Blood pressure is up.  Hold the Midodrine, readjust her dry weight.  She claims it is 45 kg, I think it may be lower.  May need antihypertensives if blood pressure remains elevated. Reinforced the need for calcium/phosphorus management. She will be seeing Dr. Ebert.

As I'm sure you recall, he is a lovely 54 year old gentleman whose history of Hodgkins disease status-post mantle radiation in the early 70's, squamous cell lung cancer status post left upper lobectomy 1/94, and coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and perioperative VT/VF arrest at the time of his LUL resection 1/94.  At that time, emergent catheterization revealed massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA, managed with extensive suction catheter use and POBA, with a good angiographic result.  No stents were placed given the thrombus burden.  Remarkably, subsequent echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted.  His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2.  He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident.  He was discharged 2/11/94, and had done well until 1/31/2095, when he presented to WSH with unstable angina, having noted new sudden onset angina and dyspnea while making his daily walk.  He had a positive troponin, and was taken urgently to cardiac catheterization, which revealed a proximal LAD lesion (felt to be the culprit) and ostial RCA lesion, both of which were stented with CYPHER stents.  At that time the decision was made to increase his plavix from 75 to 150 as an attempt to maximize his medical management, given his history and disease burden.  


Since that admission, he has done exceedingly well, and presents today without complaints.  He continues to walk 2 miles ~4 times/week without exertional symptoms.  He specifically denies chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema.  He has had no palpitations, dizziness/presyncope, or claudication.  He has significantly modified his diet to eliminate dairy and hydrogenated products/snacks, with a 5# weight loss, and is motivated to further reduce his weight.  He states that he feels ""great"" and isdoing quite well.  He does not that occasionally at this work, when he is frustrated/upset, he will take his pressure and find his systolic to be ~150, but this comes down within minutes if he relaxes, and his pressures are great at home.  He has had no GI symptoms on the aggressive antiplatelet regimen, despite not being on a PPI.


Regarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed.  His most recent imaging was 11/94, which was negative for evidence of metastasis by repor.  Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins, he is followed at RFPC on an annual basis.  


His past medical history includes:
  CAD s/p IMI '88 (totally occluded RCA with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the RCA), MI '90 (LAD stent), inferior STEMI 2/94 as above s/p POBA
  VF arrest in setting of STEMI
  Hodgkin's '81 - splenectomy, XRT
  LUL squamous cell cancer s/p L upper lobectomy 2/94
  hyperlipidemia (low HDL and high LDL - tried niaspan in the past without much benefit)
  hypothyroid
  basal cell skin CA
  nephrolithiasis


His medications include:
  Lipitor 80 mg
  Plavix 150 mg
  ASA 325 mg po QD
  Toprol 200 mg po BID
  Levoxyl
  Omega-3-fatty acids
  Multivitamin


He has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.


His family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for CAD.


He works in consulting, and travels around the midwest as part of his job.  He also works a few days a week at the local supermarket cashiering , and works as a museum docent a few times a week.  He is married, and lives in Lincoln City.  He and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 / 17 / 20 / 24; they have no pets.  He has never smoked cigarettes.  He drinks 1 glass of wine a night.


On physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 75 and a blood pressure of 129/81, with a weight of 220#.  He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.  His JVP is ~7-8 cm; he has no carotid bruits.  His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and a physiologically split S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups.  His abdomen is benign.  He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ PT pulses bilaterally.


His EKG in clinic today is NSR at 75 with possible left atrial abnormality, a nonspeciifc IVCD, and inferior Q waves in III/F, consistent with an inferior MI. 


In summary, this is a 54 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI, status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA, who represented 1 year later (1/95) with NSTEMI now s/p PCI to his RCA and LAD.  He is now asymptomatic status post this intervention  Given his history, we agree with antiplatelet therapy, with a plan for lifelong plavix and aspirin.  Should he require future invasive diagnostic procedures, it would be reasonable to decrease doses to 75 plavix/81 ASA, but we would not favor DC of either of these medications altogether.  His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records.  His LDL is near goal, with a low HDL that was unaffected by high-dose niaspan in the past.  I share his hope that with further diet/weight loss and exercise, these will both improve to goal.  


As I have discussed with he and his wife, given his history of Hodgkin's, as well as his known CAD, he is clearly at risk for future events, including the possibility of bypass surgery in the future.  We will be guided by his symptoms, and he knows to call me if he has any problems/symptoms.  It was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today.  I will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns. 


Regards,

Florence Mildred Yuan, M.D.
Endocrinology/Osteopathic Medical Center
02 Weymouth Dr
Plymouth, IN  46368

Dear Dr. Yuan:

I saw your patient, Bill Fair, in the Cardiology Office today for evaluation of his coronary artery disease in anticipation of knee replacement on March 23, 2085, and thank you for having him come here for evaluation.  I will be sending a copy of this letter to
Dr. Oliver Oates as evaluation for preop assessment as well.

Mr. Fair is a 61-year-old male who has a number of risk factors for coronary artery disease but is unaware of any known prior manifestations.  He has had diabetes mellitus for about 20 years.  About two months ago, he started on insulin, and he is now followed by you at the Endocrine Group.  His most recent glucose had been in the range of 86 with his lipids including total cholesterol of 157, triglycerides 103, HDL of 42, and LDL of 94.  His current medical regimen for these and his other problems include insulin NPH 10 units in the morning, 25 units in the afternoon, glyburide 20 mg q.d., and metformin 1000 mg q.d..  He also takes Lasix 60 mg per day, lisinopril 40 mg per day, and Lipitor 10 mg q.d.

His other risk factors are notable for hypertension, which has been labile and borderline high in the past.  He is currently on the lisinopril with apparently good control of his pressure.  He has had hypercholesterolemia and is now doing well on Lipitor.  He does not smoke cigarettes, but he is obese.

He has no known history of MI, angina, or shortness of breath.

His other risk is notable for his family history, which includes his father who died at the age of 72 of an MI as well as leukemia.  His mother died at the age of 74 of mesothelioma, and he has two sisters and one brother who are well.

He had an echo performed on February 2, 2085, in anticipation of his knee surgery in March 2085, and this was notable for a mildly dilated left ventricle with mild concentric LVH.  Overall LV function is mildly-to-moderately reduced with an estimated ejection fraction of 40%.  The entire inferior and posterior walls were akinetic and thin consistent with myocardial scar.  The apical anterior wall, apical lateral wall, and left ventricular apex were hypokinetic suggestive of myocardial hibernation or scar.  The right ventricle was normal in size and function, the left atrium was mildly dilated, the aortic valve was unremarkable, the mitral valve was slightly thickened with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, and the tricuspid valve was structurally normal.

His past medical history is notable for kidney stones, which he has had over the past 10 years or so.  He has had three or four attacks, the most recent one was two years ago.
He also has the severe osteoarthritis of the lower extremities predominantly affecting the knees.  Both Achilles tendons have been damaged as well apparently.  He is anticipating knee replacement with Dr. Oates on March 23, 2085.

Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.  He has a convenience store and frequently eats out of it throughout the day with poor dietary habits.

His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.

On exam, he is obese but comfortable.  Blood pressure is 150/80, heart rate of 67 and regular, and weight of 278 pounds.  Head and neck are unremarkable.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.  There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.  Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.  The abdomen is obese.  Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.  Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.  Distal pulses are normal.

His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with evidence of previous inferior MI and poor R-wave progression, V1 through V3.  He has a superior axis likely related to the inferior MI.  The QRS is increased with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.

Mr. Fair clearly has evidence of coronary artery disease with at least one myocardial infarction.  This had been entirely asymptomatic and was quite a shock for Mr. Fair to hear this information.  We will obtain an adenosine MIBI scan prior to his surgery to be sure we have a better idea of the status of his myocardial perfusion.  In addition, I strongly encouraged him to lose as much weight as possible.  He seems both very interested in losing weight but at the same time somewhat cavalier an overly confident that he will be able to do so.  I think the most important thing is going to be dietary management, since I doubt he will ever be able to do enough physical activity to burn sufficient calories to lose weight on that basis alone.  We will check his Chem-25 today as well as CRP, and I will review these results with him as soon as they are available.
I also asked him to check on his blood pressure at home and let me know the results.
If any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.  We will hopefully be able to identify his preop risk factor status with his perfusion scan within the next week.  Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.

Kindest personal regards.

Patient is a 34-year-old man who comes in for follow up on his newly 
diagnosed type II diabetes.  He has been very compliant with his 
medication regimen which consists of metformin 850mg PO t.i.d. and NPH 
insulin subQ q.AM.  He has had 2 episodes of sweating, but he did not 
check his blood sugar at the time.  He has not had any frank 
palpitations or lightheadedness.  He did have 1 episode where he had the 
sensation of several extra heart beats.  This was not accompanied by 
other symptoms including no chest pain.  He has never had a fingerstick 
blood glucose below the mid 150's.  I am looking through his log and see 
that his AM prebreakfast glucoses have been between 178-306 and before 
dinner they have been between 157-296.  He has already met several times 
with Makenzie Kim for diabetes education and for tailoring of his 
therapy and has met with a nutritionist to review the concepts of a 
diabetic diet.  
 
On physical exam, he is in no distress, his weight is 231, his blood 
pressure is 132/78 in the right arm sitting.
 
IMPRESSION AND PLAN: He still has high sugars. I will increase his 
insulin regimen.  He is amenable to adding a second injection and so his 
new regimen will be NPH insulin 15 units before breakfast and 15 units 
before bedtime.  And he continues to take metformin 850mg PO t.i.d. and 
I have given him a prescription for this, #90, refills 3, as well as 
syringes and needles, #60, refills 3.  He is to follow up with me in 
several months and sooner if he has new problems or concerns.  I have 
advised him about increasing his level of activity and about maintaining 
his diet and I have also asked him to contact me if he should have any 
symptoms of hypoglycemia and to obtain his fingerstick glucose reading 
at that time as well.

SDU ADMIT DATE:  01/17/05

REASON FOR SDU ADMIT:  NSTEMI;  Awaiting cardiac catheterization

CC:  55 y.o. male w/ DM type 2, hyperlipidemia, positive family history for CAD, and hx of XRT to chest for Hodgkin's lymphoma, who p/w NSTEMI



HPI:  

Mr. Fredrick is a pleasant 55 y.o. male with cardiac risk factors of recently diagnosed DM Type 2 (NIDDM), hyperlipidemia, and extensive family history, as well as, hx of XRT to chest for Hodgkin's lymphoma, who presents with chest pain, and found to have NSTEMI at Modesto State Hospital (MSH), transferred to SSH for cardiac catheterization.  Patient woke up on 1/16/05 with intermittent, stuttering ""pressure-like"" substernal chest pain, rating 7 out of 10, lasting from 15 minutes to 45 minutes.  He is very active with walking exercises, and gardening, and had not experienced this type of pain before.  The pain radiated down the left arm, his left jaw, and shoulder, as well as, causing ""throat tightness"".  He denied associated SOB, DOE, diaphoresis, palpitations, fevers, chills, N/V/D, or any other constitutional symptoms.  He took an ASA 81mg PO x1, called his PCP, and presented to MSH.



In the MSH ED, his vitals were as follows:

T: AF   HR: 109   BP: 169/81   FS: 248

EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia at 104bpm with ST depressions in V3-V5.  He received morphine 2 mg IV, ASA 325 mg, SL TNG x 2, Lopressor IV 5 mg x 3.  The chest pain resolved, and the pt has been chest pain free since.  6 hours after presentation he had 7 beat run of VT. He has not had anymore chest pain since the ER but did have palpitations with VT run. He feels his heart being 'irregular' at times.  He was started on IV heparin and an IV 2b/3a inhibitor, and transferred to SSH on 1/17/05 for cardiac catheterization.

Record date: 2098-04-01



Mr. Fredrick is a 48-year-old man status post right middle lobectomy on September 24, 2096, for T1N0 carcinoid.  He has had no complaints, since that time, and denies any stridor, wheezing, productive cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis or fever.  He has gained several pounds, but is otherwise feeling well.

On physical exam today, the patient appears quite well.  HEENT examination shows no JVD or thyromegaly.  He has no palpable cervical, supraclavicular or axillary adenopathy.  His blood pressure today is 130/88, with a regular heart rate and rhythm of 89.  S1 and S2 are within normal limits; and there is no murmur, rub or gallop.  His resting O2 saturation is 100% on room air, with a respiratory rate of 20 per minute.  His temperature is 98.6, and his weight is 232 pounds.  His chest is clear to auscultation and percussion, with good excursion and no change in tactile fremitus or egophony between the two hemithoraces.  Abdominal examination is benign.  I cannot appreciate any hepatosplenomegaly, and no other masses are identified.  He has no tenderness to palpation.  Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  His incisions are well-healed, and no nodules are appreciated.  

The chest x-ray today is unchanged, with no evidence of new nodules, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  His recent chest CT scan shows several stable parenchymal nodules and no evidence of recurrent lymphoma or carcinoid.

In summary, I am pleased to find Mr. Fredrick well, without evidence of recurrence.  The plan is to see him for follow-up in four months.

Impression	

39m with poorly controlled DM, albuminuria who comes for further mgmt dm and with recently dx'd hcv.  Over 1/2 this 25 minute visit was spent discussing modes of transmission of hcv and counseling regarding likely etiology/plans for bs, as well as disc of DM mgmt.



Plan	

DM: a1c had come down from 11.8-->9.9, but up to 10.4 last check.  now bs much better on total lantus 60u daily, split bid.  cont current regimen, recheck a1c next visit.  gave # for pt to r/s f/u with optho, last visit spring 2093.  cont metformin.  had abnl findings w/photos taken on dil exam; was to have f/u 2/94 but didn't happen.   malb elevated 97 in 9/93; on acei.  taking asa qd.  had pneumovax 2090.  foot exam nl 12/93.



Albuminuria: cont acei.  last 97 9/93.  cr stable 1.2 12/93.  follow cr on metformin.



HCV: hiv was neg.  hbv immune.  hav immune.  he had a needle stick around june 2092 at work, wasn't tested at that time for hcv/hiv, but had f/u test (for hiv only apparently) w/dr. roberson, neg at that time.  discussed that hcv may well have been from needle stick.  ruq u/s was nl, hcv genotype 1a.  lfts have been consistently nl, last 6/94.  was to have liver bx w/dr. kruse in april, but never occurred.  i will contact dr. kruse to facilitate arrangement of bx.



Atypical nevus: dnka appt w/derm for eval in march.  will rerefer at future visit.  copays $35 for nonpcp visit - difficult for him.



Hyperlipidemia: has low hdl 33 in 6/94, reviewed today & rec'd exercise.  ldl 119 on pravastatin -- inc to 40 mg.  lfts nl 6/94.  recheck lipids/lfts on inc prava next visit.



HM: lipids as above.  had Td booster 2089.  re: tob cessation/cutting down - he remains precontemplative.  tried wellbutrin in past w/no effect.  gave him # for pharm to consider Rx assistance progs, as he has been interested in this, filled out some paperwork for cheaper meds in past.  also offered to switch back to nph for cost reasons today, but he declined.

Ludlow Medical Center

Post, IN 86454

Dear Dr. Null, 

I had the pleasure of seeing Nick Hall in WSH cardiology clinic today in follow-up of his recent admission to the ICMA.  While I know that you are familiar with his history, please allow me to briefly review it for my records.  He is a lovely 53 year old gentleman whose history is remarkable for Hodgkins, status post mantle radiation in the early 70's; coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and recently diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer.  MIBI done at LMC 1/24/94 showed normal EF without perfusion defects (no scar or ischemia); he exercised 10:30 on a standard Bruce iwthout symptoms.  He was admitted 2/94 for elective left upper lobectomy for his squamous cell lung cancer (ASA was stopped 1 week prior to surgery; he was not on plavix preop); in PACU following resection, he had a VT/VF arrest and was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab, where he was found to have a massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA.  After extensive suction catheter use and POBA, a good angiographic result was obtained; no stents were placed due to the heightened thrombotic state that he was in.  Remarkably, echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted.  His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2.  He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident.  He was discharged 2/11/94, and returns today for routine follow-up.  

Regarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed.  Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins, he is followed at RFPC, and is due for an annual visit there in the next 1-2 months.  

He has been walking outside for the past ~2 weeks (since the weather improved), walking about 2 miles in around 30 minutes.  He feels well, and has had no problems.  He notes some mild dyspnea with increased exertion (climbing hills), but denies any unusual dyspnea.  He denies chest pain, SOB at rest, orthopnea (stable 2 pillow use), PND, edema, palpitaitons, or claudication.  He brings with him a handwritten record of his recent hemodynamics - his BP runs in the 100-120's/60-80's, with rare systolics in the 130's.  His heart rate has been in the 70-80's.  

His past medical history includes:
 CAD s/p IMI '88 (totally occluded RCA with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the RCA), MI '90 (LAD stent), inferior STEMI 2/94 as above s/p POBA
 VF arrest in setting of STEMI
 Hodgkin's '81 - splenectomy, XRT
 LUL squamous cell cancer s/p L upper lobectomy 2/94
 hyperlipidemia (low HDL and high LDL - tried niaspan in the past without much benefit)
 hypothyroid
 basal cell skin CA
 nephrolithiasis

His medications include:
 Lipitor 80 mg
 Plavix 75 mg
 ASA 325 mg po QD
 Lopressor 200 mg po BID
 Prilosec 20 mg

He has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.

His family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for CAD.

He works in consulting, and travels around the Midwest as part of his job.  He is now back at work.  He is married, and lives in Lincoln City.  He and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 / 17 / 20 / 24; they have no pets.  He has never smoked cigarettes.  He drinks 3 glasses of wine/week, and a cup of coffee qam.

On physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 134/75.  He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.  His JVP is flat sitting at 90 degrees, and he has no carotid bruits.  His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups.  His abdomen is benign.  He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ PT pulses bilaterally.

His EKG in clinic today is NSR at 68, with possible LAE, a nonspeciifc IVCD, and inferior Q waves in III/F, consistent with an inferior MI.  He has increased voltages consistent with LVH.

His recent cardiac tests include: 
 - echo 2/94 - EF 60%, basal inferoposterior HK, normal atrai, no significant valvular disease
 - cath 2/94 - right dominant system, patent LAD stent, proximal 60% LCx, proximal 90% thrombotic RCA occlusion (in-stent) with 100% ostial R-PDA thrombotic lesion s/p Angiojet/POBA with TIMI-3 excellent angiographic result 

In summary, this is a 53 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI, status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA.  He is asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint, and somewhat remarkably did not take a large myocardial hit from this life-threatening event.  Our attention now shifts to the prevention of future events.  Given the degree of thrombus burden in his RCA at the time of cath, he is someone for whom we would strongly advise lifelong plavix and aspirin.  Furthermore, he is not someone for whom I would be comfortable with even temporary discontinuation of one of these agents - we would advise that ANY future procedures be done on aspirin and plavix.  His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records.  I have taken the liberty today of changing him from lopressor 200 bid to toprol 200 bid to minimize any ups and downs in his beta blockade, but otherwise, would not make any changes to his regimen at this time.  We will check a full set of labs today, but I suspect that no further changes will be required at this time.  

Given his history of Hodgkin's, as well as his known CAD, he is clearly at risk for future events, and I suspect that we will take a rather aggressive stance in terms of monitoring for ischemia.  Certainly, if he has any concerning symptoms, we would have a low threshold to pursue an aggressive course.  At present, however, I am delighted with how well he is doing.  

It was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today.  I will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns.  

Regards,

RE:Fair, Bill

MR#:220-41-86-4

 

Dear Dr. Keys:

 

Dr. Oates and I saw Bill Fair today with regard to his troublesome 

right knee.  As you are aware he is a 56 year old man who is a convenience store manager.  He has had a lot of trouble with his right knee over the years, 

mainly related to sports injuries.

 

He has had in particular 2 years of pain now in his right knee.  It got so 

bad 6 months ago that he required large amounts of ibuprofen to relieve that. 

 

It has slowly got better since then.  

 

At present his main problem is pain in the knee which mainly occurs with 

activity but he also has rest and night pain.  He has a restricted walking 

distance.

 

With regard to function, he is able to carry out his work with difficulty and 

requires periods of rest in the evening on returning home from work.  He has 

noticed his knee is becoming slowly more bowed.  

 

With regard to treatment he has is taking regular analgesia in the form of 

Tylenol but has recently noticed blood in his stool for which he is going to 

have a colonoscopy in the near future.  

 

He has not tried any canes and has not had any physical therapy as yet.

 

On examination I note he has bilateral varus knees, worse on the right than 

the left.  He has an antalgic gait and marked varus thrust.  

 

He has a marked effusion that does not have any gross swelling indicative of 

arthritis.  He has a 5 degree fixed flexion deformity and flexes up to 115 

degrees.  His varus deformity is not fully correctable.  He has grade 5 

quadriceps power.  

 

X-rays reveal marked degenerative changes in his right knee with complete 

obliteration of joint space on the right side.  

 

I note he also has changes in his left knee indicative of medial compartment 

arthritis but his left knee is currently asymptomatic.  

 

We have discussed the operative options for him which consist of high tibial 

osteotomy, a unicompartmental knee replacement, and a total knee replacement. 

 

At present neither he not Dr. Oates feels that his symptoms are severe 

enough to warrant operative intervention.  We would certainly reconsider 

should he run into trouble in the next few months aspirating his knee, 

instilling some corticosteroids.  We have advised him that this will only 

provide him with short term relief but may allow him enough relief to begin 

some walking and fitness in an attempt to lose some weight.

 

We have organized to see him again in 4-6 month's time at which stage we will 

reassess him.  Should he run into trouble in the meantime he cal certainly 

ring up and make an appointment to come and see us and we will aspirate the 

knee and instill some corticosteroid.  

 

With kind regards.  

 

Yours sincerely,

Margaret Alvarez, M.D.

Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, Internal Medicine

96 Burton Drive, Suite 659

Kings Mountain, MT  11361



Dear Margaret,



I had the pleasure of seeing this patient in the Cardiology Clinic at the Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital.  Since I last saw Ms. Law, she underwent a 3-vessel coronary artery bypass surgery, internal mammary to the left anterior descending artery, free right radial graft to the obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex, and reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery.  She tolerated the surgery quite well and had a short rehab stay.  Currently, she is doing some walking, but is still feeling quite tired and a bit deconditioned.  However, her breathing does feel better than prior to the surgery.  She has some residual sternal wound pain, but it has improved since her discharge.



Current Medications:

1.  Aspirin 325 mg daily.

2.  DuoNeb.

3.  Diltiazem 300 mg p.o. t.i.d.

4.  Furosemide 40 mg p.o. daily.

5.  K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. daily.

6.  Metolazone 2.5 mg daily.

7.  Toprol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

8.  Pravastatin 20 mg p.o. daily.

9.  Furosemide 40 mg p.o. daily.

10.  Colace, ferrous sulfate, ibuprofen, senna.



Adverse Medication Reactions:

1.  Azithromycin.

2.  ACE inhibitor, cough.

3.  Latex, angioedema.



On physical examination, heart rate 81, blood pressure 106/75, and weight of 246.  In general, she is well appearing, in no apparent distress.  Jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water.  Carotids are 2+, no bruits.  The chest is clear to auscultation and percussion, a well-healed median sternotomy, regular rate and rhythm.  No significant murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, no masses, bruits, organomegaly.  Extremities:  1-2+ edema.



Review of labs dated 05/28/2134, potassium 4.3, creatinine 0.9, ALT 16, AST 16, total cholesterol 125, triglycerides 106, HDL 36, and LDL 68.



In summary, the patient is a 62-year-old woman status post CABG, doing well.  She does appear to be mildly volume overloaded today, therefore I will make the following medication adjustments.  As far as her cardiac meds, they will change to aspirin 81 mg daily, potassium 20 mEq daily, Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d., metoprolol succinate 100 mg p.o. daily, and pravastatin 20 mg p.o. daily.



I will titrate her Lasix on an outpatient basis to have her lose 5-7 pounds to improve her shortness of breath as well as her edema.  We will ask VNA to draw labs as well.



I will see her again in 2 weeks' time.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions.



Warmest regards,

SOCIAL HISTORY:former Construction Worker, lives with mother



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: blood pressure is 130/70, pulse 90 and regular.

     Fundi not well visualized. periorbital edema, conjunctival injection, neck was supple, 

     carotid upstroke normal chest clear to auscultation and percussion, S4 no S3 gallop or rub,

     Abdomen, soft, nontender. Bowel sounds are normal. Extremity 

     1+ edema. 

     

IMPRESSION: end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, seizure

     disorder thrombosed A-V fistula, volume overload.



HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent revision of her left upper arm A-V fistulae by Dr. Schmitt

On 8/30/86 without complications. Because her arm was swollen her subsequent dialysis was done 

Utilizing a temporary femoral dialysis catheter. She was noted to be persistently anemic with a 

Hematocrit of 23.3% on 9/05/86. It was felt that her low hematocrit was due to both blood loss from

Persistent severe menorrhagia as well as a dilutional component from fluid overload. She was electively 

transfused 2 units of packed cells on 9/05/86 while on dialysis utilizing her revised A-V fistulae. 

The rest of her hospital course was uneventful. She was hyperphosphatemic in hospital and was given dietary counseling for use of her phosphate binders. She was discharged home with recommendations for a GYN

Follow-up to assess her persistent mennorhagia and for f/u with her vascular surgeon Dr. Schmitt. She will continue 3x/week dialysis in her Educare-Pullman outpatient unit.

Interim History:	

Comes to review his medical problems.



Hip X-Rays may have shown early degenerative changes. Still has pain from them on a daily basis but it is minor. Has not tried any analgesics, even acetaminophen. 

Shoulders have bothered her for years and she has seen Dr. Baird with diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis. Hands have bothered her in the past but do not currently. 



A1c has been over 9 % and she says that control has not changed. Does not have records but says that she tests about tid.

Retinopathy:	Saw Dr. Aragon a few weeks ago. Now going only yearly. Last laser was about 2.5 years ago. Reports that vision was 20/20 in one eye and 20/25 in the other.

Nephropathy:	Cr was 1.4 in July. Says that transplant clinic wanted her to return a month after the last visit but she did not want to do so. She thinks that it was for follow-up of an elevated WBC. However, her WBC has been normal over the last several visits. 

Neuropathy:	Not consistent with taking the Neurontin, and notes it she misses it.

Cardiac:	No chest pain or unusual dyspnea on exertion. Does feel out of shape if she climbs    100 stairs   .  She is seeing Dr. Dotson in two weeks.  

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Medications: no changes

RE:  Francis, Lydia
PAH#:     981-82-02

SUBJECTIVE: Lydia has been doing well since her right total
hip arthroplasty in January of 2089.  She still has pain in
the right hip and the left hip, which is likely due to
osteoarthritis.  She has been taking Percocet for pain
control.  Fortunately, she is not having problems with
constipation, as she is taking a stool softener.  She is
taking calcitonin and Evista for her osteoporosis.  In
addition, she has had a history of right tibial
osteomyelitis and is taking prophylactic Levaquin, without
evidence of GI upset or antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  She
is taking Cozaar for her blood pressure control, and is also
taking Neurontin for pain control.  At home, she is wearing
a firm brace that Dr. Younce has prescribed.  In addition,
she is using a walker for ambulation when outside the house
and a cane when inside the house.  She comes today for her
appointment with her son.  She arrived in a wheelchair.

On examination, her blood pressure today is 138/80 with a
pulse of 80 and a respiratory rate of 16.  She is afebrile.
Cardiac exam is a regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, without
murmurs.  Her neck is supple, although she does have
paracervical pain to palpation.  Her lungs are clear to
auscultation.  She has pain throughout the paraspinal
muscles in the thoracic and lumbosacral area.  She has some
pain with flexion at the hip, with limited motion at both
hips.  She has no evidence of lower extremity erythema or
edema.  Her peripheral pulses are intact.  Her patellar
reflexes are absent.  She has good pedal pulses.  She denies
depression and overall is encouraged.  She plans a trip to
Peru soon.

Medications are updated in LMR.

DISPOSITION: She will follow up with me for a complete
physical examination in November of this year, and she will
be fasting at that time.

Dear Dr. Craft,

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Division on Tuesday.  This lovely gentleman with coronary artery

disease requiring previous stenting and mild systolic dysfunction

notes that he had to participate in the resuscitation of his son,

who remains in the Beechwood ICU last night.  Despite this

intense stress, he has no clear dyspnea on exertion,

palpitations, lightheadedness, or chest discomfort at the present

time.  He continues on aspirin, Lasix 60 mg a day, Isordil 40 mg

p.o. t.i.d., Zestril 40 mg a day, Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d.,

simvastatin 20 mg a day, Norvasc 5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Prevacid,

multivitamins, and K-Dur in addition to his insulin.

 

On physical exam today, his blood pressure is 180/75.  His heart

rate is 54 and regular.  Respiratory rate is 10.  There is no

increase in jugular venous pressure.  Carotids are without

bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout. 

Cardiovascular exam is notable for lateral PMI, S4, S1, and

physiologically split S2.  His abdomen is soft and nontender.  He

has no bruits.  His extremities are warm with strong symmetric

pulses and motor strength throughout.  He has no peripheral edema

at the present time.  His electrocardiogram is notable for sinus

bradycardia, evidence of prior inferior myocardial infarction,

and lateral downsloping S-T, which are unchanged from his prior

electrocardiograms.

 

Mr. Joshi presents today with a euvolemic volume status, but a

concerning blood pressure.  At this point, he notes that he is

actually taking his Isordil b.i.d., and I will let him continue

to do that.  We will increase his Norvasc to 10 mg, and he will

be following up with you within the next few weeks.  If there are

any other thoughts in the care of this gentleman, please give me

a call.

 

Sincerely,

 

Dictated By: Corrine James-Wagner

EDVISIT^42521583^ZASTROW, IRENE^11/01/85^CONNER, VICKIE

The resident's history, physical examination, and evaluation

reviewed by me and I concur.  In addition, I personally

interviewed and examined this patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old female who

presents for evaluation of chest pain.  The patient had no

history of coronary artery disease until the last week.  She was

apparently in Pennsylvania where she had been for the last week.  She

had been having 5 days of epigastric and substernal discomfort. 

She considered it to be indigestion and have been taking Tums. 

After approximately 5 days while in Pennsylvania, she felt that the

discomfort was not improving.  She did feel like that she had

less energy for her usual activity.  She went to a hospital there

in her land of Pennsylvania where she was noted to have a positive

troponin.  She underwent a diagnostic catheterization that did

show multivessel disease with an occluded LAD.  She subsequently

underwent a therapeutic PCI with stenting of her LAD.  She did

have recurrent chest pain today after catheterization, which was

much more severe, sharper in nature per her description.  She was

told in the hospital in Pennsylvania that this was due to reperfusion.

 She returned home today, called her primary care physician and

was advised to come to the Emergency Department for evaluation. 

She does state that since discharge from the hospital in Pennsylvania

earlier this week, she has had intermittent episodes of more

severe left anterior chest pain, which she describes as somewhat

more sharp than the indigestion feeling she was experiencing

before.  It is not always associated with exertion.  It sometimes

radiates to her left shoulder.  It is not pleuritic in nature. 

It seems to be intermittent, although she does have a low level

of dull aching pain, which has been fairly constant since her

discharge from Pennsylvania.  She denies any shortness of breath.  She

is able to lie flat.  Denies any lower extremity edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for type 1 diabetes, which is

fairly brittle per her report.  She is status post MI within the

last week.  She also has a remote history of PE in the past and

is no longer on Coumadin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke.  She lives with her husband

and has recently returned from Pennsylvania.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and is also positive for CAD.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  All other systems are reviewed and are also

negative except per the HPI.

MEDICATIONS:  Include insulin, Plavix, aspirin, Nexium, Lipitor,

and atenolol.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has allergies to iodine and Indocin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 98.6, her pulse 65,

respirations 18, and blood pressure 105/69.  The patient is

awake, alert, pleasant female who is reclining in no acute

distress.  Her head examination is normocephalic and atraumatic. 

Her pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Her sclerae are

anicteric.  Her conjunctivae are pink and moist.  She has moist

mucous membranes and appears well hydrated.  Her neck is supple

and nontender with full range of motion.  The JVP is not

elevated.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with

equal breath sounds, no respiratory distress.  No accessory

muscle use and no chest wall tenderness.  Her cardiac examination

is regular rate and rhythm with no murmur, rub, or gallop.  Her

abdomen is nondistended, soft, and nontender.  No guarding, no

peritoneal signs, and no organomegaly.  Her skin is intact, warm,

dry, and slightly pale.  There are no rashes.  Her back is

nontender with full range of motion.  Extremities reveal no

cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Her calves are soft and nontender

with no palpable cords and full range of motion with normal

strength and tone.  She is alert and oriented x3, very pleasant. 

Cranial nerves are intact, and there is no motor or sensory

deficit.  Rectal examination performed by the resident reveals

heme-negative stool with normal tone.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was placed on a cardiac

monitor.  IV access was maintained.  Laboratory studies were sent

and EKG was also ordered.  Her prior records from Pennsylvania were

reviewed.  Her white blood cell count is 8.4, hematocrit 37, and

platelets 285,000.  Her electrolytes are within normal limits. 

Her BUN is 18, creatinine 0.8, and glucose 112.  Her CK here

returned normal at 33.  Her MB was 0.4.  Her troponin returned

elevated at 0.39.  This is in comparison to the troponin from her

records of Pennsylvania, which was 0.2.  Her d-dimer is less than 200.

 Her INR is 1.1.  The patient had an EKG, which showed evidence

of a new T-wave inversions, present on prior EKG from this

hospital.  She was started on heparin for concern of unstable

angina status post MI, remained hemodynamically stable, and is

admitted to the Cardiac Service.

DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain, rule out unstable angina.

(584) 728-8734

SUBJECTIVE:  The patient returns having been in Maine for
the winter in the past five months.  Her husband visited
ever three weeks or so.  She is walking somewhat better with
less pain but moves very slowly.  She says that for the past
two weeks she first had some substernal pressure which moved
down into her abdomen and now instead of having one bowel
movement every one or two weeks she is having a bowel
movement three times a week which is formed and not bloody. 
 She put herself on Pepto-Bismol and is gradually getting
better.

She has not had any chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations,
cough or hemoptysis.  She has no visual signs.  She has not
been seen by the ophthalmologist recently.  Her hearing is
good.  She has mammograms yearly.  She sees her gynecologist
on a yearly basis, Dr. Giles, having changed from Dr. Godfrey.
 She is not sexually active.  

She is not dieting and has not lost any weight.  Her back
pain is somewhat better.  

MEDICATIONS:  She is on the following medications:  
1.  Lipitor 20 mg q.d. 
2.  Glynase 1.5 mg b.i.d. 
3.  Avandia 4 mg q.a.m. 
4.  Trandate 100 mg q.d. 
5.  Tegretol 300 mg in the a.m. and 200 the evening (changed
to 200 mg b.i.d.).  
6.  Neurontin 200 mg b.i.d. 
7.  Premarin 0.625 mg 30 days a month.  
8.  Provera 5 mg 12 days a month.  
9.  Enteric coated aspirin 81 mg q.d.
10. Calcium 1200 mg q.d. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Her diabetes has been poorly regulated
and hopefully the Avandia will make her feel better.  She
states that she takes the Avandia in the morning and she
feels very weak at lunchtime such that she has to get an
orange juice.  She says that her blood sugar has dropped but
when she checks it, it has been around 100 mg%  and I
explained to her that it is a normal blood sugar but it may
be that the drop causes her to have symptoms.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She weighs 192 lbs stripped which is a
weight gain for her.  Her blood pressure is 122/76 in the
right arm sitting with a wide cuff.  She appears as a well
developed, pleasant white female, grossly overweight, moving
slowly and can only get up on the examining table with help
because of her back pain.  There is no icterus, cyanosis or
edema.  The pupils are round, reactive and equal and react
equally to light and accommodation.  Nose and throat
examination is unremarkable.  Neck veins are flat.  Carotids
are 2+ and equal and without bruit.  Lungs are clear to P&A.
 Breasts reveal no masses or discharge.  The heart is not
enlarged.  There is a regular sinus rhythm and no
significant murmurs.  S1 and S2 are of normal intensity. 
Liver and spleen are not felt.  Bowel sounds are normal. 
There are no abdominal masses or tenderness.  This is a
female escutcheon.  Rectal was deferred.  She has fair
peripheral pulses and decreased vibration sense in her feet.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Diabetes mellitus, poorly regulated.  Will check
glycohemoglobin today.  
2.  Diabetic neuropathy.  
3.  L2-L3 disk with fusion.  
4.  Hypercholesterolemia on Lipitor.
5.  Weight management problem.

3.  Hyperkalemia: Recirculation studies with HD today.

4.  CAD risk: Check fasting lipids, start ECASA 81mg qd, wean diltiazem and methyldopa and increase lisinopril as tolerated by BP.  Would not start beta-blocker at present until hypoglycemic episodes resolved.

5.  INR: Aiming for INR 1.5-2 - adjust coumadin accordingly.

6.  PO4: Start Phoslo 667mg po tid with meals.

6.  Dispo: Needs social work, PT, OT to see, as does not appear to be safe at home.

Re:  Verna Cantu
ESH #:033-98-74


I had the pleasure of seeing Verna and her daughter in my office today after her aortic valve replacement with a 19 mm Magna Ease, aortic root enlargement, and two-vessel coronary bypass grafting with a LIMA to the LAD and a saphenous vein to the posterior left ventricular branch.  

As you know, she is a 60-year-old woman with a history of peripheral arterial disease, aortic stenosis, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease who has had progressive dyspnea on exertion especially with walking up into her house which is 25 stairs.  We did her surgery, and she had a very uneventful postoperative course.  

She was discharged home on postoperative day seven and has continued to make progress.  She is walking each day.  Her medications include 5 mg of Norvasc, 25 mg of Toprol-XL, 20 mg of simvastatin and an aspirin and her Plaquenil.  She has no complaints of pain.  She is eating well.  She is sleeping well.  Her incisions have healed nicely.  Her sternum is stable, and she has no murmurs.  Overall, I am extremely pleased with her progress.  I told her to suggest to you that she was interested in cardiac rehab which she should be able to start in the next week or two.

Thank you so much for the opportunity of caring for her.

EDVISIT^47646361^JAY, COREY^01/29/65^TOMLIN, THEODORE

The patient was seen on 01/29/2065.  I confirm that I have

interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's

documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ""Foot infection.""

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46-year-old man

with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes, blood sugars in the

140s this week, chronic renal insufficiency on hemodialysis

secondary to diabetes who had a bilateral TMA who presents with 3

days of right heel ulcer, discharge and foul smelling order.  No

erythema.  The patient had decreased sensation in bilateral feet

secondary to diabetic neuropathy.  He denies nausea, vomiting,

fevers, abdominal pain, cough, shortness breath, or chest pain. 

The patient is blind and speaks Spanish.  He also has a history

of hypertension.

The rest of the past medical history, social history, family

history, surgical history, review of systems, allergies, and

medications as per the resident's note.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.2, pulse 78, respiratory

rate 20, blood pressure is 201/104, and saturation 99% on room

air.  General:  No apparent distress, cooperative.  HEENT: 

Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils were bilateral cataract

blindness.  Conjunctivae were clear.  Oral mucosa was moist. 

Neck is supple.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no

wheezes or crackles.  Cardiac exam:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No

murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdominal exam:  Good bowel sounds,

nondistended, nontender, and soft.  Extremity exam:  No ankle

edema, calf tenderness, or asymmetry.  Musculoskeletal

examination:  The patient has bilateral TMA.  Skin exam:  The

patient has dry gauze at soles of his bilateral feet; however, he

has a 1 cm diameter ulceration in the heel of his right foot that

is crusty and has some yellowish discharge on gauze.  It indeed

has foul odor.  It is nontender.  Neurological examination: 

Motor strength 5/5 throughout all extremities.  Sensation

decreased bilateral feet, to the ankles.  Rest of the lower

extremities were intact to light touch and symmetrical.  Vascular

examination 2+ radial and DP pulses.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  A 46-year-old man diabetic with

foul smelling foot ulcer.  Possible diagnoses is cellulitis, soft

tissue infection, or osteomyelitis.  The patient's WBC was 6.2. 

Hematocrit and platelets were normal.  He was slightly dry.  His

BUN was 40.  His creatinine of 7.4; however, it was decreased

from his hemodialysis yesterday.  Sodium was 139, potassium was

5.0.  An x-ray of his foot of the right did not reveal any

osteomyelitis; however, given his four smelling odor and

yellowish discharge on his dressing, we elected to treat him with

3.375 mg of Zosyn.  He also received Tylenol for some pain.  The

patient blood pressure remained high and at one point it was

232/109.  He received 10 mg of hydralazine, 10 mg of labetalol IV

as well as 100 mg of labetalol p.o.  The patient's blood pressure

went down to 140/82 prior to admission.  The patient's primary

care physician was called who agreed with the admission to the

Medical Service.

DIAGNOSES:

1.  Diabetic foot ulcers.

2.  Hypertension.

Cardiovascular Medicine Consult Service Consult Note
X. R. Xi, MD, PhD
Vascular Medicine Fellow, #45811

Date of Consultation: June 11, 2098

ID: 70 year old male from Missouri
Reason for Consult: Perioperative consultation prior to aorto-bifemoral bypass surgery

History of Present Illness:
	This 70 year old gentleman was diagnosed with an occluded distal aorta in mid-2097 after an attempt at cardiac catheterization via the femoral artery.  
	Over the last several months, he has had exercise limiting lower extremity pain     he describes primarily left leg burning (thigh, calf) when he walks, coming on over about 150 yards.  If he pushes further, he will also get right leg burning in a similar distribution. 
	He also has had a marked increase in CR over the past 8 monts (1.1 -> >4).  Based on non-invasive imaging, this has been attributed to renal artery stenosis.  His ACE-I (?ramipril) has  been held, without improvement.  A referral was recently made to rule out bilateral RAS, and he had an invasive aortogram yesterday.  There was an 85% proximal right RA stenosis, and a 40% left RA stenosis, perhaps only partially explaining the elevated Cr.  The angiogram also confirmed the occluded distal aorta (below the renal arteries, the SMA is patent).  An aortobifem plus right RA revascularization is planned.
	He has had reduced functional capacity for some time.  He gets claudication within 150 yards, but he also has been limited by exertional dyspnea.  He complains also of orthopnea (3 pillows), PND, as well as bilateral LE edema.  He also has noticed his weight continuing to creep up which he attributes to fluid retention.  He is avoiding salt, but not fluid restricting.  His lasix dose has not changed.  He has been angina free since his CABG surgery.  He has not had palpitations or AF since the immediate post-op period.  A ROS is otherwise unremarkable.

Past Medical History:
Coronary artery disease
MI 2084
Developed limiting angina in late 2096, early 2097
CABGx4 on November 05, 2097 (Dr. Ehlers)
CABG x 4 (LIMA - LAD/ Sequential graft: SVG1 connects Aorta to D1 then OM1/ SVG2 - LVB2
Incidental anomalous circumflex off the right coronary artery
Pre-op EF 50-55% with infero-posterior hypokineses (?post-op)
Bicuspid aortic valve (not replaced with CABG according to notes)
Mild AS, Mild AI only on pre-CABG echo 2097
Hypertension

Occluded distal aorta (diagnosed after cardiac catheterization attempt in 2097)
Small infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm 3.6cm
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (x2 years at least)
On coumadin for stroke prevention and amiodarone from maintenance of NSR
Currently in NSR
BPH
Chronic back pain
Renal insufficiency (Creatinine 4.1) non-oliguric - ?cause
Cr normal November 2097
Gradually increased over November from 1.1-1.6, ang then was ~4 when recently checked
Attributed to Renal artery stenosis based on non-invasive imaging (duplex, MRI), though 
Right inguinal hernia repair

Denies VTE, denies pulmonary problems.

Current Medications:

Metformin HCL 500mg daily
ASA 81mg daily 
Lasix 40mg daily,

Zetia 10mg daily prn
Coumadin 5mg qd	

Allergies:
Flecainide (arrhythmia).

Family History:
Noncontributory.

Social History:
Married, lives at home with his wife.  Exsmoker.  Minimal alcohol, no other substance abuse.

Review of Systems:
Noncontributary.

Physical Examination:
Mildly tachypnic RR 24.  BP 160/90 right arm.  HR 60 reg.  Afebrile.
Head and neck examination unremarkable.  No bruits heard.
JVP markedly elevated at the angle of the jaw.  The CP is delayed in upstroke, and mildly reduced in volume.  There is S1 S2 and a II/VI SEM that is high pitched and peaks in mid to late systole.  The Apex is hard to feel, but slight diffuse and sustained.  The abdomen is obese, distended, nontender, and there is no organomegaly or masses.  The patent   s distal pulses are difficult to feel, and despite the bilateral TEDS there is bilateral lower extremity edema.


Investigations:

EKG: Normal sinus rhythm
Note: Aortogram report is not on LMR

Na 140		WBC 6.59
K 4.3		HgB 8.0
Cl 104		Plt 165
CO2 25		Hct 25.8
BUN 80		INR 1.2 (coumadin held)
Cr 4.45		PTT 30.8
EGFR 13
Glu 74
Ca 8.3
Mg 2.4

Impression and Plan:

This gentleman is currently mild fluid overloaded (CHF) and hypertensive; this should be improved prior to any proposed surgery.  The issues include:
Congestive heart failure     I suspect there is worsening fluid retention primarily due to his worsening renal function.  I would consider:
increasing his diuretic (eg. Lasix 80 mg iv bid) to improve diuresis and get him euvolemic.  Hopefully this will work; if not, he should have ultrafiltration so that he is not in heart failure for his operation.  He will be at high risk of CHF post-op, and likely will need an ICU bed
consider starting hydralazine/nitroglycerin combination in lieu of ACE-inhibitor for afterload reduction
consider a pre-op echo     we probably should check his EF and bicuspid aortic valve to exclude severe AI and severe AS
Prevention of periperative MI
He should continue his ASA, atenolol, statins/zetia peri-operatively
No further testing for ischemia necessary unless is LV function on echo is markedly reduced (recent CABG, no angina)
Even with best medical care, for his proposed surgery and his comorbidities he carries a substantial risk for perioperative cardiac complications (roughly 5-10%)
Prevention of perioperative AF
Continue his atenolol and amiodarone perioperatively
Restart coumadin post-op for stroke prevention long term
Endocarditis prophylaxis
He will need perioperative antibiotics given his bicuspid aortic valve

We will follow with you     he may need a couple of days to treat his heart failure/fluid overload prior to surgery.

Plan: 

1.	chest pain: Unlikely cardiac in origin given negative EKG, recent normal stress test, and atypical nature. Likely GI related as pt with dry heaving around time of chest tightness.

-cont asa, simvastatin, atenolol, irbesartan, and lasix

-repeat EKG in AM

-cycle cardiac enzymes, telemetry

-check lipid panel

-maalox prn



2.	decreased visual acuity: Most likely worsening macular degeneration given recent chronic history of symptoms. Absence of pain makes retinal vascular occlusion very unlikely, no other neurological symptoms to indicate CVA. 

-refer pt back to MVH once ruled out for MI

-consider I- CT if more neuro symptoms develop to r/o acute stroke



3.	Diabetes: -check lipid panel, hemoglobin A1c

-RISS, glipizide

-hold pioglitazone (not in formulary)

She's doing much better from her painful R facial weakness (? Ramsay Hunt syndrome).  She di dnot take tegretol, but rather increased her amytriptiline and added some darvocet acutely, now off these meds.  Her R eye ""tears a lot"", at no particular time (ie, not necessarily when she's masticating), and occasionally it burns....but she has not developed conjunctivitis or ocular redness or discharge.  She has difficulty chewing opn the R side of her mouth, and finds she""pockets"" food in her R cheek; she manages by chewing on L, and swallowing frequently, especially taking extra liquids.

The pain has receded-  she now only gets ""a twinge"" now and then.



Husband has noticed she's not hearing quite as well.



Her current meds include amitryptiline 25 hs, mevacor 20, procardia 30 bid, furosemide 40x3, isosorbide 20 qd allopurinol 300 qd.  She's releived to learn the results of her recent blood work, including BUN 65 Creat 3.4, Hct 29.8



On exam, she has gained weight since I last saw her; she comes in ok0on wheelchair, but is able to take a few steps with her straight cane, and climb onto the examining tabloe with only contact guard. Dense catarcts; fundi not visualized; EOMS full without ptosis or nystagmus. Cornelas are brisk pilaterally, but she has decreased sensationon the R lower facial segments (V1, V2); excellent masseter and temporalis strength. R lower facial weakness, with less evident weakness of orbicularis oculi; he manages to close the eyelid almost completely; + Bell's phenomenon.  She hears finger rub at 90 cm on R, 70 cm on L; Weber lateralizes to the R, but Rinne' positive bilatyerally (ie, AC>BC AU). Tongue midline.  Modulates voice well.  TMs opaque, but EACs clear.



She has a marked polyneuropathy, with decreased vibration from knuckles to elbows bilaterally Hyporeflexia throughout, but symmetrical.  Strength remains well conserved.



IMP: improving R Bell's. MRI showed much motion, but no gross abnormalities



Plan- continue with current management. I'd welcome the oportunity of seeing her again in about 6 months.

FREEPORT MEMORIAL HOSPITAL



History of present illness   Ms Rivers was hospitalized 1/22-1/24/67 after presenting to ER with left shoulder pain that evolved to an ache radiating to her chest and forearm, associated with nausea, diaphoresis, dizziness.  In the ER, the pain was characterized as mechanical, but was also relieved by SLNTG (which however precipitated hypotension, brady to 30s). EKG showed only ? slight exaggeration of baseline 1mm ST elevation in V2, V3.  She was heparinized and admitted to SDU.  R/O by serial markers.  Cardiac cath on the day after admission showed a tight RCA (with unclear relationship to anterior ischemia seen on prior stress). She is now s/p Cypher stent, with plans for at least three months of Plavix.

He reports that results of her event monitor revealed no arrhythmias.  He concurs that her episodes sound like they may be related to vagal episodes. 

- 1/05/67:  f/u brain MRI and EEG scheduled by neuro 

- 1/24/67:  Called patient and reviewed that she will need to reschedule her MRI given her new stent (~8 weeks)

Anemia

A:  Appears to have had Hct ~ 35, MCV ~ 73-74 for > 10 years.  Per patient, has thalassemia trait.  Per pt, has had negative colonoscopy. -1/21/67: B12 was wnl 9/66, but iron studies were omitted

SDU JAR Admit Note



Name:	Rivers, Ida	

MR: 468 48 69	

Date of Admission: 06/17/66



Cardiologist: Valdivia



CC: 73 yo woman with h/o Sjogren's syndrome, Diabetes (?Type I), vascular insufficiency who now presents with syncopal episode.

		

HPI:  Ms Rivers was in her USOH until the morning of admission, when she went into the city to buy some buttons and pay a bill at ViewSonic.  She noted that she was not feeling well throughout the morning, and she felt as if she may need to eat something.  However, because she did not have her insulin and blood sugar monitoring equipment, she decided not to eat.  She continued to feel poorly (she is somewhat vague on symptoms but reports feeling that her chest was congested and that she may have had some palpitations and felt chilled).  She saw a police cruiser, and walked over to it with the intention of getting help.  When she arrived, there was no one in the car, and she leaned forward to rest her head on the front of the car.  This is the last thing she remembered; when she awoke, she was surrounded by people.  She was told that she had falled backwards and hit the back of her head.  When EMS found her, she was confused, making repetitive statements, and stating that she had pain in her occiput that radiated down her neck.  When she arrived at the FMH ED, her blood pressure was 213/97 HR 84 RR20 O2 sat 99% RA Temp 97.3.  She received Labetolol 20 iv, Toradol 30 mg iv, ASA 325 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg po x 1.  Her mental status cleared somewhat, and her blood pressure came down to 130s/80s.  She did have one episode of emesis, during which her HR was noted to transiently dip to the 40s (not captured on the monitor); spontaneously recovered to the 60s.

She had a C-spine series and head CT which were negative for acute process, and a CXR which was negative except for R shoulder not well-visualized on CXR.  She was noted to have some superficial bleeding of her posterior scalp, but no obvious laceration.  She was admitted to the SDU because of the episode of bradycardia.

	1.  No active disease seen in the chest.

	2. Mild degenerative change of the right acromioclavicular joint

	is noted.   Limited evaluation of the shoulder demonstrates no

	other significant abnormality. Dedicated shoulder imaging is

	recommended as clinically indicated.



C-spine films:

IMPRESSION:

	NO EVIDENCE FOR CERVICAL SPINE FRACTURE OR DISLOCATION.

	MULTILEVEL DEGENERATIVE CHANGES, MOST SEVERE AT C5-6 AND C6-7.

	

Head CT:

IMPRESSION:

	No evidence of an acute intracranial process.  Ventricular

	dilatation that may be mildly out of proportion to sulcal

	enlargement.



EKG: 

NSR rate 74, J-point elevation V2

____________________________________________



Impression: 

73 yo woman with h/o Sjogren's disease, ?Type I DM now admitted with syncopal event.  DDx includes hypoglycemia, seizure (unlikely), vasovagal episode, arrythmia or ischemia.



Plan: 	

1.Cardiac

Ischemia: Continue ASA, B blocker as tolerated for elevated BP.  Cycle enzymes, monitor EKG for new changes.

Pump: Echo today to assess function, r/o valvular disease or outflow obstruction.

Rhythm: In NSR, continue on monitor to assess for arrythmia.



2. Respiratory: ED CXR shows no significant pulmonary disease.  



3. Endocrine: will continue her home Lantus and use CZI Regular.  Will need to contact HMC re: her care. If she is Type I diabetic, will need basal insulin.  No evidence of DKA on urine or labs.  Check TSH, Hgbaic.



4.  Rheum: h/o Sjogrens, extent of her disease unclear.  Will contact her rheumatologist at RGH.  Consider dedicated R shoulder xray once rules out to assess for possible fx, particularly if pain persists.



5.  Neuro: imaging negative.  She is slow in her responses; monitor closely for evolving neuro sx.

  

6.  GU: Follow urine output.



7.  ID: Afebrile. Normal WBC



8. Hem: HCT stable.  Follow closely



9. F/E/N: replete magnesium, K prn.



10. Prophylaxis: nexium.

He then saw his ophthalmologist at the Shenandoah Hospital in Parchman who concluded that this is not due to macular degeneration.  He denies having headaches or any other symptoms at that time.  He denies similar episodes of &#8220;floaties&#8221; in the past and he has no Hx of headaches, disarthria, motor deficits, sensory loss and has never been hospitalized with a stroke or TIA.  He recalls having &#8220;high kidney function&#8221; in the past, but does not recall details.  His PCP arranged for an U/S evaluation, which was done on 8/05/81 and showed 80-85% stenosis of the L proximal ICA.  Patient has had surgeries in the past and had no adverse effects to anesthesia administration.  He considers himself fit and in good shape.

Reason for visit   Annual examination.



History of present illness   The patient has done very well over the last year.  He has maintained his weight, which has been quite difficult given the social commitments that he has.  He is requiring to eat out quite a bit.  He has also done a large amount of traveling over the last three to four months.  This caused him to be more exhausted than usual.  His incarcerated hernia repair has stood up.  He has some discomfort occasionally in that area, but for the most part feels that this is back to normal.  He is careful with his diet as much as he can be.  He had a cold over the last month or so.  It slowly resolved.  He is asymptomatic presently.

Review of systems   Recent night sweats, chronic tinnitus, leg cramps on walking, no GI or urinary problems, and notes some easy bruising.



Physical examination

Pulse   72 and regular

Blood pressure 120/70  

General appearance   Well appearing

Heent   Oropharynx clear

Neck   Carotids, no bruits.  Thyroid, nonpalpable

Assessment and plan   The patient is generally doing well.  His cardiac risk management is doing fine.  His blood pressure is in good control.  His recent cholesterol profile is excellent.  He has slightly elevated fasting blood sugars.  We discussed options including diet and exercise which I think he has been very good on.  Discussed starting metformin based on recent data that this may help prevent his development of diabetes.  We will begin metformin 500 mg PO QD.  We will check his renal and liver function in one week and his bruising is likely due to his aspirin.  We need to follow up on a renal ultrasound for cysts that were discovered during his hernia operation, and I will make these arrangements.  The patient is to return to clinic in three months     Coronary artery diseas



Selected recent labs   We reviewed his laboratories.  These were done earlier in the week.

Russell, Donna

Ms. Russell comes in for further evaluation.  She has been in Rhode Island for 
six months.  Her complaint is that she has heaviness in the chest.  She 
does not have any palpitations.  She does not note that this is 
associated with exertion.  She does have diaphoresis associated with it.  
She does not have any shortness of breath.  This heaviness has been in 
her chest on and off for the last six weeks.  She is quite concerned.

She has a history of hypothyroidism and hypertension.  She also has 
hyperlipidemia and is being treated with Lipitor.  Her health 
maintenance has been in order.  She has just had a hysterectomy.  She 
needs to have a follow-up mammogram done.  However, today I am most 
concerned about her chest heaviness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 130/80, respiratory rate is 
20 and pulse is 68.  Neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  
Chest is clear to both percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam is 
regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen is soft and 
nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are clear of 
cyanosis, clubbing and edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Her sodium is 145, electrolytes are all otherwise 
within normal limits.  TSH is 2.0.  LFTs are pending at this time.  We 
sent her for an electrocardiogram, which showed normal sinus rhythm with 
nonspecific ST-T wave changes.  We also sent her for an exercise 
tolerance test with preliminary reports showing that she went to a 
maximum heart rate of 108, she was on the protocol for 6 minutes 50 
seconds.  She had no evidence of ischemia.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.	Chest heaviness.  I am not sure what is causing this.  She may have a 
primary pulmonary problem.  She will be following up with us in one 
week.  It is heartening to see that she does not have an abnormal 
exercise tolerance test.
2.	Hypothyroidism, well controlled at the present time.  Continue same 
dose of Synthroid.
3.	Hypertension, well controlled presently.
4.	Hyperlipidemia.  We will recheck this on her next visit.

RE:  Roberta Vincent
     MR #380-18-32-2
 
Dear Dr. Xanthos,
 
We had the privilege of seeing your patient, Mrs. Roberta Vincent, in
the Renal Services Clinic on January 18, 2093.  We will
not repeat her history as you know it well. Over the past three
months Mrs. Vincent has complained of increasing fatigue,
occasionally sleeping more than 12 hours per night, forgetfulness
and tingling of the fingers and toes. She has maintained a
relatively good appetite and denies nausea, vomiting or shortness
of breath.  An Iothalamate GFR test obtained on December 14, 2092
revealed a glomerular infiltration rate of approximately 10 ml per
minute, suggesting profound loss of renal function.
 
On physical examination today her weight is 99.5 kilograms or 219
pounds.  Blood pressure is 150/90, pulse is 80 and regular.  The
lungs are clear. There is no peripheral edema. Again, there marked
cushingoid features. Despite overall weight loss, Mrs. Vincent
comments that she has gained facial and abdominal fat as well as
facial hair over the past several months.
 
In summary, Mrs. Vincent appears to be developing early symptoms of
uremia.  Given her advanced azotemia we believe that she should
undergo creation of an arteriovenous fistula so that she may start
dialysis within the next several months. We have arranged to
recheck her chemistries today.  We would also recommend that she
undergo repeat work up for her cushingoid features.  Although renal
failure may alter hormonal balance and may promote occasional
androgenic features in woman, this is beyond ordinary.
 
Thank you once again for allowing us to participate in her care.

RE:                  Oliver Jain
LEPROSARIUM:              962-85-18


Dear Dr. Colon:


I am writing to inform you that I am seeing Mr. Oliver Jain in followup.  Mr. Jain was admitted to my service in transfer for right lower extremity ischemia and gangrene following atheroembolization from a popliteal aneurysm, as you know.  He was admitted in early September and stayed until early October.  During his hospital stay here his wounds were addressed.  He underwent angiograms to evaluate his arterial anatomy and he underwent reconstruction of the right wherein covered stent graft was used to cover disease in his proximal femoral artery and then he underwent an above knee to below knee popliteal artery bypass using PTFE with ligation of the aneurysm.  He also subsequently underwent angioplasty of his posterior tibial artery.  Given his atheroembolic phenomenon he had very limited vasculature remaining in the foot and I was concerned that the forefoot gangrene would progress and he would wind up losing the right foot.  In the interim since his discharge he appears to be doing quite well.  The gangrene of the right foot has remained stable with clearcut demarcation of the right first, second and third toes.  He also has some heel ulceration that I am hoping to nurse through.  He denies any rest pain or pain in the foot.  He has no evidence of fevers, chills, rigors or shakes in the interim.  He has since been discharged to home and has been walking with a walking shoe.  His left lower extremity aneurysm is yet to be treated and he has not developed any symptoms with regards to the left lower extremity.  He has been taking his Coumadin regularly and has had therapeutic INRs as he reports.  


On exam today he is doing quite well.  He is in good spirits and appears much better than in the hospital.  His head and neck exams were unremarkable.  His lungs were clear.  Heart was regular.  His proximal groin and leg incisions have healed up nicely, however there is some dry eschar on the midportion of the wound.  With regards to the toes he has clearcut demarcation and heel ulceration.  There is no evidence of cellulitis, induration or infection of the right lower extremity.  He continues to have a stable looking foot on the left.  Given his extensive peripheral vascular disease I performed PVRs in the office today, which revealed that he has pulsatile PVRs at the right calf and ankle.  He also has slight pulsatile PVRs at the right transmetatarsal level.  This bodes well with regards to his revascularization as well as his potential to either heal or remain stable with regards to the necrosis on the right foot.  His left calf, ankle and transmetatarsal PVRs were similar.  


In summary, this is an unfortunate gentleman who developed atheroembolic phenomena resulting in digital ischemia as well as heel ischemia with the potential for limb loss in the near future of the right lower extremity.  He does have an untreated aneurysm on the left with potential for atheroembolization of the left lower extremity.  Given this concern, I will proceed next with a left lower extremity revascularization to exclude the popliteal aneurysm so that he does not develop limb-threatening gangrene of the left.  With regards to the right I will try to initiate some hyperbaric oxygen therapy and will probably re-evaluate his distal circulation with an angiogram at the time of his next admission or some time thereafter.  I am hoping to facilitate healing of the heel wound with the final outcome of a transmetatarsal amputation of the right lower extremity but will see how it goes.  My thanks again for this referral.  I apologize for not sending you correspondence earlier.  With this correspondence I will send you his operative diagram as well as his most recent discharge summary.


Sincerely,




Quincy T. Uselton, M.D.

History of Presenting Illness
Mrs. Cantu is a 60 year old female with a history of peripheral arterial disease, aortic stenosis, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease.

For the past year she has had dyspnea on exertion, especially with a flight of stairs. She must stop at the top to rest. She denies chest pain, lightheadedness, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, syncope, or lower extremity edema. A recent echocardiogram in February revealed an ejection fraction of 71%, mild mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 45mmHg, mean of 29mmHg, and a valve area of 0.8 sq cm. There are no wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle. A stress test in February revealed a reduced exercise capacity with a small area of mild apical ischemia and ejection fraction of 77%. A cardiac catheterization on 3/8 revealed 50% left main stenosis, 40-50% left anterior descending, 30% circumflex and 50% right coronary artery stenosis. Aortic valve area was noted at 0.98 sq cm. Carotid non-invasive studies revealed bilateral 20-49% stenosis.

She was referred to Dr. Gonzalez for an aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. She presents today for preoperative testing and evaluation. She currently notes dyspnea on exertion with two flights of stairs. She denies chest pain, dizziness, or diaphoresis.

The patient was seen on 07/03/2075 with Dr. Ellington.  The patient

was interviewed and examined by me.  Resident's note was reviewed

and confirmed.  Plan of care was discussed.  Please see

resident's note for details.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 74-year-old woman

with history of insulin-dependent diabetes and end-stage renal

disease who presented to Emergency Department after an episode of

confusion associated with a blood sugar in the field to 67 (per

EMS) and responsive to orange juice with normal mental status

upon arrival in the ED.  On further history, it seems that the

patient took her usual dose of insulin this morning and ate

breakfast but missed lunch and dinner because of a flood in the

basement that had preoccupied her.  She has had prior episodes of

hypoglycemia associated with skipping meals.  Otherwise, she has

been feeling well.  No recent change in medications.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, asthma, CVA/TIA,

and end-stage renal disease (predialysis).

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, diltiazem, Nephrocaps, methyldopa,

Flovent, and Pravachol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Awake, alert, sitting up in bed, and

eating supper.  No acute distress.  Temperature 97.2, pulse is

81, respirations 16, blood pressure 170/82, and pulse oximetry

100% on room air.  Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm.

 Lungs are clear.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  Skin is warm

and well perfused.  Neurologic:  Alert and oriented x3 and

nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG:  Without ischemia.  White count 9.4, blood

glucose 93, creatinine 8.5, sodium 140, and potassium 4.9.

CLINICAL IMPRESSION:  Hypoglycemia in setting of renal failure

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

PLAN:  To lower NPH dose from 30 to 25 units.  PCP, Dr. Mcgee

was e-mailed.  The patient will follow up with him on Monday.

SUBJECTIVE:  The patient comes in stating that she has had 5
days of substernal pain like a ""ball pressing in on her
chest.""  She has also had abdominal pain and has felt quite
poorly.  She did call this service this past weekend she
states and never received a call back.  She called me this
morning, and I saw her immediately.  The pain has not gone
down her arms and it is mostly located in her chest.  She
feels occasionally like she is going to throw up, and she
says that her blood sugars have been quite high.  She does
have diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her lungs are clear to P&A.  Her
blood pressure is 130/80 in the right arm sitting with a
pulse of 64.  Her neck veins are flat, carotids 2+ and equal
without bruit.  Heart is not enlarged.  There is a regular
sinus rhythm, and no significant murmurs.  Liver and spleen
are not felt.  EKG taken shows a possible old anterior
myocardial infarction, which is a distinct change from her
last EKG with poor progression of the R waves across the
precordium.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Question myocardial infarction. 
Because of her prolonged pain and changes in the EKG, I
think that she should be observed in the BH emergency
ward and attend her there.

Interim History:	

Comes to review her medical problems.

Her ETT showed mild distal anterior and antero-apical ischemia. The last p-CABG ETT was done in September, 2074, and did not included nuclear images. The electrocardiographic portion of both tests was considered to be uninterpretable because of inadequate elevation of the heart rate. Dr. Dotson asked her to double the atenolol dose. Since she has had low BP in the past, we increased it to only 25/12.5. BP 80/50-90/60 at home and she has not felt so well, tired. Not sure whether the dyspnea on exertion that led us to get the ETT has changed since she has not challenged it. 



Home Blood Tests:  Not very good by history. A1c over 9%. She still has trouble focusing on it. 

Retinopathy:	Visions stable.

Nephropathy:	Cr slightly up to 1.5

Cardiac:	above

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Has had flu shot this year.



Review of Systems: above



Physical Exam:	

Looks well.

BP:   110/76   120/80 by me (not sure she took meds this AM)		P:   72, regular	

Wt:   167 without shoes, up 4

Neck:	No JVD

Chest:	Clear to auscultation

Heart:	Normal S1; ? physiologic S2.  No gallops.  No murmurs

Extremities:	No edema.            





Impressions and Plan:	

Reduce the captopril to 6.25 mg bid.

Report back BP; may have room to go up to 25 mg bid on the atenolol.

She does have some hypoglycemia and symptoms are sometimes subtle. Stressed the likely greater difficulty in perceiving hypoglycemia on beta blockers. 

Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine



Appointments:	As scheduled

ID/CC:	

sob



HPI:   	[Per patient, chart]

85F hx CHF, COPD, DM2, HTN, PVD (s/p mult procedures) p/w acute sob this AM. Pt reports she has had a bladder infection off and on for the past several months manifesting as urinary urgency, frequency, dysuria. Went to WGH Pecos clinic 1 wk pta and received fosfamycin. Went back on Tue w no resolution of sx and says med was changed (? to nitrofurantoin per ED pass-off). On Friday AM, woke up with sob. Felt bloated in her stomach and had difficulty w breathing when trying to get dressed. Sob much worse w activity, would resolve w lying down, associated w diaphoresis. Pt denies CP at the time of the episode (reports some subsequent short-lived R-sided CP in WGH ED, similar to R-sided CP she has had    off and on for awhile    wh she did not mention to the ED staff). Denies palpitations, arm or jaw pain. Denies increase in LE edema, no recent change in meds, excellent medication regimen compliance, not a lot of salt in diet, and no recent diet changes. Pt does sleep on mult pillows but says she does this because of her reflux disease. Pt does think she had similar sob 1-2  yrs ago when she was admitted to WGH, told she had CHF, and was diuresed. Because of her symptoms on Friday 12/09/88, pt went into WGH Pecos clinic. Per Pecos note, EKG at that time showed ST depressions in I,aVL, V5, V6, II/III/aVF. Pt received ASA 325 and lasix 40 mg IV, and was sent to WGH ED.



ED Course: On arrival to WGH ED, pt had VS T 98.2, P 74, BP 160/70, RR 24, O2 Sat 95% RA. Pt's EKG was read as showing ST depressions in V4-V6. Pt received NTG sl x 1, lopressor IV 5 mg x1, lopressor 25 mg po x1, and reportedly EKG changes improved w rate control. CXR in ED was clear. BNP was in 1400s (vs 6000-12000 during prior WGH admissions where CHF was diagnosed).

___________________________________________

Impression:

85F w hx CHF, CAD, COPD in w exertional sob that started on AM of admission. Pt has been undergoing treament for persistent UTI. While sob is likely multifactorial from CHF and COPD, COPD exacerbated by recent illness is most likely etiology.  CHF is argued against by: normal BNP (especially in comparison to elevated BNP in 6000s on prior admission for CHF), clear CXR, clear lung exam, and pt is still having exertional CP similar to what she felt on AM of admission.  If one believes her EKGs demonstrated ischemic changes, this would support an explanation that her sob is an anginal equivalent. However, ST changes appear minimal on close evaluation of EKG changes. Cardiac enzymes are negative so far.



Plan: 

1.	SOB

a.	Cont to cycle cardiac enzymes. Negative so far.

b.	Cont tele

c.	Atrovent and albuterol nebs

d.	Cont home lasix dose for now. Does not appear to be volume overloaded.

e.	Pt has not received stress test which was recommended after most recent WGH admission. Would pursue this now to help sort out whether ? EKG changes are real and indicative of significant ischemic disease. At current level of dyspnea, pt would not be able to do a treadmill test.

f.	PT/OT consults.

2.	UTI

a.	Repeat UCx

b.	Per pt and chart, multiple allergies, though pt is unclear on specific reactions. Will start tetracycline po based on urine culture data from 12/03/88.

Palacios, NE  73819                             97198841

                                              12-25-90 







The patient is a 36-year-old man who comes in with a problem list that 

includes diabetes, high cholesterol, microalbuminuria, and probable lichen simplex 

chronicus.



Since I last saw him, he has changed insurances and needs new refills on 

all his medications. He has been without it for a couple of days. He has 

had no polyuria or polydipsia, and generally feels well. He has no chest 

pain, shortness of breath - no abdominal discomfort. He has no problems 

with is feet or eyesight. He has not seen an eye doctor in the past 

year.



MEDICATIONS:

Lisinopril, metformin, simvastatin, Glyburide. He is not currently using 

the metronidazole pill any longer. 



Laboratory Data: Last cholesterol was an LDL of 101 in September, Hgb 

A1C of 6.1.



PHYSICAL EXAM:

Patient is well appearing. His blood pressure is 140/82 in the right arm 

sitting, but this is also off his lisinopril. His weight is 168 lbs. 

Examination of the feet reveals response to vibratory sensation and 

light touch. There are no lesions. There is an approximately 2cm 

nonscaling plaque over the dorsal lateral aspect of the right ankle, 

which is pruritic.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1. Diabetes mellitus. Wait until he is back on his medications before 

checking his laboratory tests, including the microalbumin. He will come 

back in a few months to have these done.

2. Hyperlipidemia. I will check his lipids on his return visit.

3. Lichen simplex chronicus. Topical lidex was prescribed b.i.d. to the 

effected area only.



I will see him in several months in follow up visit on his laboratory 

work.

EDVISIT^92819461^STEPHENSON, BREDNA^07/15/86^WALLACE, VELMA

I saw this patient on 07/15/2086 in conjunction with Dr. Echols. 

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,

reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and

discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the

patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 68-year-old female with leg pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with known coronary

artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes, status

post left fem-pop bypass and transmetatarsal amputation of her

left foot at the Siouxland on 05/02/2086.  This was complicated by

acute renal failure with creatinine between 1.6 and 2.4 and

labile sugars.  She was discharged to rehab on 04/19/2086 for

approximately 1 month.  Subsequently, she developed left thigh

erythema, swelling, and pain along the incision site yesterday. 

She has had no fevers, nausea, or vomiting but has had difficulty

ambulating due to pain, denies any diarrhea but has had some mild

stomach upset.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable as I said for hypertension,

diabetes, CHF, chronic renal insufficiency, peripheral vascular

disease, and hypothyroidism.  She had MIBI in 2084 with LAD and

D1 lesion.  Her EF was 35%.  She had a CABG in 2083.

Social history, family history, and review of systems are as per

the written note.

MEDICATIONS:  Amitriptyline, atenolol, aspirin,

hydrochlorothiazide, insulin, Lasix, lisinopril, Norvasc,

Synthroid, Zocor, and Zoloft.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, in no

acute distress, however, distinctly uncomfortable.  Vital signs: 

Temperature is 97.2, pulse 59, respiratory rate 20, blood

pressure 148/67, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.  For

full physical exam findings, please see the resident's written

note.  Specifically, HEENT, neck, abdominal exam, and neurologic

exams are within normal limits as documented.  Respiratory exam

reveals crackles at the bases but no respiratory distress. 

Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm with 2/6 systolic

ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.

This patient was seen in combination with Dr. Lance Camacho.  His note reflects our joint assessment and plan.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, Ms. Levin is a 54-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who has known coronary artery disease.  She had an exercise test in 2076 for some vague symptoms, which was positive, and led to cardiac catheterization.  This catheterization revealed 60% LAD lesion, 50% first marginal, 60% RCA, and a 70% diagonal lesion.  She was maintained on medical management with few symptoms.  She has been lost to followup from Cardiology Clinic.  She has within the last week developed increasing symptoms with minimal exertion.  She underwent a stress test in which she was able to exercise for 6 minutes and 9 seconds on the Bruce protocol.  She achieved 93% of age-predicted maximal heart rate.  At 4 minutes, she developed 2 mm ST segment depressions in the anterior leads associated with chest discomfort.  She is a vague historian, but has not had clear rest anginal symptoms.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, she is mildly obese white female.  She has no jugular venous distention.  Her carotids are 2+.  Her heart shows normal S1 and S2.  There is a 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex.  Lungs are clear.  Abdomen is benign.  Extremities show no cyanosis or edema.  Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm, normal axis and intervals.  There is no evidence of ischemia or infarction.

ASSESSMENT:  Ms. Levin is a 55-year-old diabetic woman with progressive anginal symptoms with known moderate 3-vessel coronary artery disease from 4 years ago with at least moderate risk, positive stress test.  After discussion with Dr. Camacho, our plan will be continue her on aspirin, beta-blocker, and a low-dose ACE inhibitor through her regimen.  She refuses to take a cholesterol-lowering agent due to previous concerns with myalgias.  She will be referred for cardiac catheterization within the next several days with a goal to better define her coronary anatomy for the possibility of percutaneous coronary intervention versus cardiac bypass surgery.

Diabetes Management Consult 






CC    

Asked by Dr Vines to see the patient for assistance with management of diabetes mellitus.
 She is intubated so details of medical history not available other than what I can get from medical records and her daughters who are with her.



HPI   

72year old female patient with a history of diabetes diagnosed &gt;20 years ago.  Patient is treated with diet and oral hypoglycemic agents at home. Prior to admission patient was taking metformin 500 mg qday.  Patient tests blood glucose at home but results unknown. Patient has had/not had recent episodes of hypoglycemia. Pt has known retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy.



Hospital course since admission:
 Pt has a history of COPD/interstitial lung disease with biopsy confirming BOOP on home O2 last 2 weeks and prednisone since 12/79, OA s/p bilateral knee replacements, chronic venous stasis, and s/p biological AVR 11/78 presents with several month h/o SOB. She states increasing SOB since 9/79 and now has difficulty with any activity. She had chest pain this previous week at her rehabilitation facility/nursing home and was evaluated at OSH. She was found to have anemia with hct 25 and increased troponin to 1.5. Pt was found to be CHF and is being treated with IV lasix. Was diagnosed with SBE with BC positive for enterococci and gemella morbillorum. Was initially on Vancomycin then later switched to Ampicillin and gentamycin for 6 weeks course(till May 11) as per ID recs. GI was consulted for guaiac positive stool and Hct drop. But over the course of hospital stay her Hct was stable and stool guaiac negative so GI deferred scoping her till her is clear of infection. Pt was also found to have RLL PE and is on Lovenox.LENIS Bilateral LE negative. Thyroid nodule with FNA negative. Plan was to transfer her to rehab and schedule her for AVR when she is clear of infection. But unfortunately she went into resp distress this AM 04/12/80 and got intubated.

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Chest pain



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

Dr. Fredrick Debra is a 59 yo with CAD, HTN, and DM2 who presents with three days of chest discomfort and hypertension.  His symptoms started on Tuesday afternoon, three days ago, while working in the yard.  He describes substernal chest pressure that waxes and wanes in intensity, but has been constant since its onset.  It does not radiate.  It was associated with &#8220;gurgling&#8221; like &#8220;loose phlegm&#8221; in his chest at its onset, but this has since resolved.  It was worse while sitting in the car or leaning forward or backward, but not with twisting.  He has not had any recent URI symptoms.  Tylenol helps take the edge off of his discomfort.  He has been measuring his BP at home, and over the past few days it has ranged to 190/102 averaging 170/80.  He reports compliance with his medications without recent changes.  He has had worsened dyspnea on exertion, stating that he could walk 1+ miles one week ago, but could only manage 1/4 mile today.  He sleeps on two pillows with no changes, and he denies LE edema.  His anginal equivalent includes jaw and neck pain and mild substernal chest pressure without radiation to his arms; he states his current symptoms are not consistent with his angina.  



He called Dr. Upham, his cardiologist, and was told to increase his Lasix frequence to 20 mg BID.  He was encouraged to come to the SSH ED for his symptoms given his history of CAD (below).  On arrival, the vital signs were T 96.7, P 71, BP 166/81, RR 18, Sat 97% RA.  He had negative kiosk biomarkers and no EKG changes.  He received NTG x3 without much relief and ASA at home.

Youssef Nall, M.D.
Ludlow Medical Center
45 Wilder St
Post, IN  86454


Dear Dr. Nall:


It was a pleasure to see Nick Hall again in the Cardiology clinic at Wytheville South Hospital in followup of his post myocardial infarction care.  As you are well aware, he has many coronary risk factors.  He is a 55-year-old gentleman with past history Hodgkin's disease, status post mantle radiation in the early 2070s and left upper lobe lobectomy in 2094 for early stage squamous cell lung cancer that was complicated by VT/VF arrest.  He has history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, as well as overweight.  He does not have a former history of type 2 diabetes, but on recent screening, his hemoglobin A1c has been elevated at 8%.  His prior history of coronary artery disease dates back to 2087 and 2090 when he had non-ST elevation MI and coronary interventions to his LAD and RCA.  He has subsequently had a VT/VF arrest during his lobectomy in 2094, which required emergent coronary angiographic resuscitation where he was found to have a massive thrombus throughout his right coronary artery that required thrombectomy and POBA with good results.  He remarkably has had a preserved LV function after all of these infarctions with only some basal inferoposterior hypokinesis.  In 01/2095, he developed recurrent exertional and then unstable angina, presented to Wytheville Sanitarium Hospital Emergency where he was considered to be high risk acute coronary artery syndrome with positive troponins and proceeded to the catheterization clinic where he again had proximal LAD and RCA occlusions, both which were intervened with drug-eluting Cypher stents with good results.  Since then, he has been doing well and has been instructed to be on double dose clopidogrel 150 mg lifelong and full dose aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily lifelong.


We see him in followup today, and again, he has no limitations in his exertional capacity.  Work has been tough in consulting and he is now working 2 jobs including overnight shifts, which is strenuous at times.  He is looking for work as a dog walker and will find out soon whether he can quit his evening jobs and will be able to increase his exercise capacity such that he will be doing more walking with that job.  He has no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, presyncope, or syncope with exertion.  He has no signs or symptoms of heart failure.  He has been taking his blood pressures at home, which range at about 126/81 to 142/92 with an average of 135/85.  His heart rates have been in 50s-70s.  He has had no side effects to his medications.  He is not smoking and he is not drinking alcohol.  He says that he walks for 2-3 miles when the weather is nice, but given that it has been a harsh winter, he has not been doing this often.


His current medications, aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o. daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily, levothyroxine 125 mcg p.o. daily, and metoprolol sustained release 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.


Physical Examination: Nick looked well.  His weight was 232 pounds, his blood pressure was 153/89 in the right arm and 150/95 in the left arm with a large cuff, and his heart rate was 69 and regular.  His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and normal carotid upstroke and contour.  There are no bruits.  His chest is clear to auscultation.  He was not clubbed.  His cardiovascular exam revealed a normal left apex and normal S1 and S2 with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.  He had no peripheral edema.  His abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly.  His pulses were palpable 2+ throughout.


EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 61, minimal voltage criteria for LVH and left atrial enlargement.  Prior inferior Q-wave MI.


Lab values from today:  His electrolyte panel was notable for sodium 144, potassium 4.1, chloride 107, bicarb 28, creatinine 1, urea 16, normal calcium, normal LFTs, and normal CK level.  TSH was also normal.  Hemoglobin A1c was elevated at 6.8%.


Lipid levels:  Total cholesterol 164, TG 145, HDL 33, LDL 102.


Echocardiogram from last year revealed normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65%.  Mild left atrial enlargement, no LVH.


Impression:  Nick is still borderline hypertensive, and in the setting of having survived multiple myocardial infarctions, Hodgkin lymphoma and now declaring himself as potential glucose intolerant and early diabetic, I think it is time to start an ACE inhibitor as we have discussed previously.  We started him on ramipril 2.5 mg today and he will increase that to 5 mg a day after tolerating it for 2 weeks.  He will take his blood pressures at home few times a week.  To simplify and decrease his beta-blocker regimen we switched to atenolol 100mg daily today.  We also discussed increasing his lipid management by adding niacin again starting at 500 mg extended release for a month and then he will increase that to 1 g a day.  He was cautioned on the adverse potential reactions of facial flushing and headache and he was instructed to take his aspirin 325 about 30 minute prior to his niacin to minimize these potential side effects.


With regards to his coronary artery disease, all this time we have assumed that his atherosclerosis has been secondary to high dose radiation exposure when he was a child.  Nevertheless, Dr. Turner had a great suggestion that we screen him for quantitative platelet function inhibition, given we recently started performing this test at WSH and previously had recurrence on normal strength doses of clopidogrel and aspirin.  The results may not changes our current management strategy, but it may give us insight into his premature CAD etiology, particularly coronary artery thrombus, as well as play a future role in familial screening.  To that end, we have requested light transmission aggregometry for platelet function inhibition.  We have also requested a thrombophilia workup, including factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C and S levels, antithrombin level and homocysteine and CRP today.


Otherwise, I believe Nick is doing well.  We will see him again in 6 months' time with follow up on these studies.  If by then he still has evidence of diabetes, and trouble losing weight, we will refer him to our nutritionist for counseling and refer him to hadley memorial hospital.  He may need a structured monitored exercise program in order to help improve his exercise capacity.  


This patient was discussed with Dr. Turner in clinic.


Yours sincerely,

Re:	Bill FAIR

	OMC 220-41-86-4



Dear Dr. Mcmahon:



I had the pleasure of caring for Mr. Fair at OMC 03/20-21/05.  He is a 61-year-old man with CAD, DM, high cholesterol, HTN, and family history of early CAD, who had a stress test that showed peri-infarct ischemia in the left circumflex and PDA.  Angiography showed a codominant system, a 100 percent left circumflex occlusion, an 85 percent RC lesion, and nonobstructive LAD lesions.  The left circumflex was recanalized and a Taxus 2.5mm by 32mm stent was placed.  The procedure was done with Angiomax and the sheath was pulled manually.  There were no complications.



He spent an uneventful evening without complaints or complications, ambulating without difficulty.  His groin was soft and tender with ecchymosis but no hematoma.  Extremities were warm with 1+ edema to the ankles; pulses were 2+ throughout.  Morning labs included cholesterol of 114, triglycerides 109, HDL 34 and LDL 58.  He was discharged home on NPH insulin; Mucomyst, 600mg bid; aspirin, 325mg qd; atenolol, 25mg qd; Lasix, 60mg qd; glyburide, 10mg qd; lisinopril, 40mg qd; Lipitor, 40mg qd; Diovan, 80mg qd; Plavix, 75mg qd; metformin, 500mg bid to be restarted on 03/23/85; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.  He will require aspirin for life and Plavix for six months; he will not stop either medication unless told to do so by you.  His HDL is low and given his degree of atherosclerosis, you may wish to start gemfibrozil or Niaspan.  He will see you in follow-up in the next two weeks.

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Fall



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

                Pt is an 88 yo woman with a PMH of DM, HTN, mild dementia and baseline anxiety with a hx of falls who was admitted following a witnessed mechanical fall which resulted in a Type III dens fracture and R superior/inferior pubic ramus fracture. 
She was seen by ortho, and they recommended use of an Aspen collar for the dens fracture, and no operative management for the pubic ramus fracture.  On 11/15, patient was noted to have a decreased Hct, which was attributed to an expanding hematoma on her right thigh, and she was given 2 U of PRBCs from 9:30am-5pm on 11/15.  Overnight her O2 requirement increased from 2L to 4L, and she was given Lasix in response to a chest X-ray which showed signs of pulmonary edema.  Throughout the day patient became progressively more agitated, and in addition to her standing Seroquel (12.5 mg bid), she was also given two doses of Zyprexa (2.5mg and 5mg).  Overnight on 11/15-11/16 she became febrile, up to 103.5, peaking at 105.6 in the morning on 11/16, despite standing Tylenol.  Blood cultures and urine cultures were taken, and patient was started on Levoquin, Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone, and transferred to Team E.

Urine culture: No growth



RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES

CXR

     IMPRESSION:

     

     Bilateral pulmonary edema, more prominent than 11/14/77



EKG

Initially unable to obtain because of pt&#8217;s tremor.  When more calm, EKG was irregular, no acute ST or T wave changes.

            

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

                88 yo female with a PMH of DM, HTN, severe anxiety and history of falls presenting with pubic ramus and dens fracture, now with new fevers, rigidity and tachycardia.



ISSUE #1: Fever and tremors.  Differential includes infection, seizure, NMS or serotonin syndrome.  A temperature of 105.6 with no obvious infectious source does make infection seem less likely, however patient will be treated empirically with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and levoquin for possible hospital acquired aspiration pneumonia or meningitis.  An LP will be attempted if it can be safely done without compromising the patient&#8217;s respiratory status, and in the context of the patient&#8217;s tremor.  In the context of recently receiving Seroquel, Zyprexa and Fluoxetine, it is also possible that patient could have either serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which could explain the patient&#8217;s elevated CK, elevated WBC, elevated LFTs, extremely high temperature and tremor with rigidity.


Continue to follow lytes, CK, CBC
 
Small doses of Ativan for tremor/anxiety
 
AVOID all neuroleptics (typical and atypical)
 
Continue antibiotics, F/U cultures



ISSUE #2: Type III Dens fracture and pubic rami fracture.


Keep in C collar, manage rami fracture medically



ISSUE #3: DM.  Continue FSGs and RISS.





ISSUE #4: Anemia.  Continue to follow Hct and monitor hematoma on R thigh



PROPYLAXIS

DVT: Teds, Pneumoboots

BOWEL: Colace, Senna prn



CODE:  Full code (discussion continuing with family)

Follow-up for labile hypertension.  At the time of our last visit, she 

began Procardia XL 30 mg daily and completed a series of 24 hour urine 

tests.  All of the urine tests returned normal.  After being on the dose 

of Procardia, she noticed some continuation of her symptoms and Dr. Iniguez 

suggested that she increase the dose to two tablets daily.  She has been 

on that dose for the last two weeks and has noticed dramatic change in 

her symptoms.  Shes having much fewer spells and her blood pressure, 

likewise is much lower than it had been.  Overall, she is pleased with 

these results.

 

Her other medications have remained the same although she has 

discontinued using immediate release Nifedipine and Nitroglycerin both 

sublingual and patches.

 

BP initially 142/52, later by me 170/68

Weight 155 lbs.

Pulse 68

Her examination remains unchanged except she has 2+ edema in her left 

leg and 1+ in the right leg.

 

Assessment:  Labile hypertension-clinically improved.

 

Plan:

 

1.  Change Procardia XL to 60 mg once daily and continue other 

medications as is.

2.  I suggested that she return for her regular follow-up with Dr. Gibbons 

and Dr. Iniguez.  I would be happy to see her in the future but do not 

feel that additional visits here are necessary.

ADMISSION DATE: 07/01/2095               DISCHARGE DATE: 07/08/2095
     
     
     
     PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Chest wall pain.
     
     ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: History of diverticulitis abscess, status post
     percutaneous drainage on 01/18/2095 with a colocutaneous fistula;
     hypertension; fibromyalgia; gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophageal
     motility disorder; history of right tibial osteomyelitis in 2086; history
     of osteoarthritis, status post right and left total hip arthroplasty in
     2088 and 2089; varicose veins with a history of chronic venous
     insufficiency ulcers in the past; status post esophageal dilatation,
     12/2093; atypical chest pain.
     
     PROCEDURES: Surgical consultation with Dr. Yonathan Orth; interventional
     radiation radiology consultation; adenosine sestamibi stress test;
     pulmonary embolus CT of the chest; abdominal CT scan.
     
     HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old woman who is a
     Broadcasting and Performing Arts Manager who had been in the McDonough County Nursing Home until the day
     of admission when she woke up with right-sided and epigastric chest
     discomfort associated with shortness of breath that was associated with a
     feeling of warmth rising from her upper abdomen up to her face.  She
     described no radiation discomfort to her left arm, no diaphoresis.  She has
     had these episodes in the past.  She was noted to be hypertensive at the
     McDonough County Nursing Home, up to 200/130, and was given metoprolol 50 mg and
     multiple sublingual nitroglycerins.  She was sent to Pan American Hospital
     for further evaluation. In the emergency room, she received 3
     nitroglycerins, Tylenol and morphine which helped relieved her pain.
     
     PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for the above, plus ischemic colitis. In
     addition, she is debilitated and has lost a significant amount of weight,
     approximately 40 to 50 pounds since January.  She also has asymptomatic
     gallstones.
     
     MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg daily, Epogen 400 units subcu 3
     times a week, mirtazapine 15 mg at bedtime, megestrol acetate 200 mg daily
     until 07/15/2095, Colace 100 mg b.i.d. p.r.n. constipation, zinc 1 p.o.
     daily, multivitamins 1 p.o. daily, Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily, metoprolol 50
     mg b.i.d., methadone 5 mg b.i.d., isosorbide 20 mg t.i.d., ferrous sulfate
     325 mg p.o., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily, lactulose p.r.n. constipation,
     Dulcolax p.r.n. constipation, oxycodone 5 mg q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain.
     
     ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.
     
     PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She weighed 88.7 pounds, pulse 68 and regular,
     respiratory rate 20 and unlabored, room-air oxygen saturation was 97%,
     blood pressure was 160/90.  General appearance: Cachectic, elderly woman
     who was in no acute distress.  HEENT: Mucous membranes were dry, pinpoint
     pupils that were minimally reactive, extraocular motions were intact,
     oropharynx without erythema.  JVP 4 cm supine.  There was no
     lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.  Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, S1-S2.
     There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.  Chest:
     Clear to auscultation.  Abdomen: There was an IR drain in place in the left
     lower quadrant without external drainage.  The abdomen was soft with mild
     tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant without rebound or
     guarding; bowel sounds are present throughout.  Extremities reveal no
     edema.  There were chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally and ecchymosis
     on the left side of her foot.  Pulses were 2+ and symmetric.
     
     Neurological exam: The patient has significant weakness of the bilateral
     lower and upper extremities with -4/5 strength of the hands and 2+ strength
     in the hip flexors, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, calf, and anterior
     tibialis.
     
     LABORATORY DATA: On admission, white count 7700, hematocrit 30.3, platelets
     443,000.  INR 1.4, potassium 4.0, creatinine 0.8, CPK and troponin were
     negative x3.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without changes of ischemia.
     Chest x-ray revealed no congestive heart failure or pneumonia.  Her
     adenosine sestamibi stress test revealed no evidence of EKG or reversible
     perfusion defects.  She did have evidence of a fixed defect in the inferior
     heart with hypokinesis, with an LVEF of 75%.  CT of chest with a PE
     protocol did not reveal any thrombus.
     
     HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Yonathan Orth
     of general surgery.  The patient had expressed an interest in considering
     colectomy after initially refusing colectomy since January 2095.
     Initially, this was due to concerns about possible transfusion needs during
     surgery.  After extensive
     conversations with Dr. Orth and with her family, and with the patient,
     I believe that the comorbidities associated with the surgery and
     perioperative healing, far outweigh any potential benefits that she may
     have from this potential surgery and therefore we collectively decided not
     to pursue this.
     
     Chest pain: The patient had no evidence of ischemia by cardiac biomarkers.
     Adenosine sestamibi did not reveal any reversible defects.  She will
     continue to be treated with antihypertensives.  Her chest wall pain is
     likely due to esophageal spasm.
     
     Gastrointestinal: Her esophageal spasms and GERD will be treated with PPI.
     
     Chronic pain syndrome: She has chronic pain from osteoarthritis and
     fibromyalgia.  This has led to debilitating weakness in upper or lower
     extremities and reliance upon chronic pain medications. At the time, we
     will continue pain medications for her comfort.  Continue aggressive bowel
     regimen.
     
     Feeding: The patient needs a soft mechanical diet in order to allow her to
     eat and masticate as she has no dentures at present.  The family currently
     working to try to obtain dentures for her.
     
     Resuscitation status: Per the patient's wishes, after extensive
     conversation with family and patient, she does not desire heroic
     intervention and is DO NOT RESUSCITATE AND DO NOT INTUBATE.
     
     DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily, Tylenol 650 mg p.o.
     p.r.n., vitamin C 500 mg p.o. daily, aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, Colace 100
     mg b.i.d., Epogen 4000 units 3 times a week, ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o.
     daily, isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg p.o. t.i.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily,
     milk of magnesia daily p.r.n. constipation, megestrol acetate suspension
     200 mg p.o. daily to terminate on 07/15/2095, metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
     mirtazapine 15 mg p.o. at bedtime, multivitamins 1 p.o. daily, oxycodone
     p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain, Zocor 20 mg p.o. daily, zinc sulfate 220 mg p.o.
     daily, methadone 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
     
     DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred back to the McDonough County Rehabilitation Center.

1.	Presentation of wheezing and hypoxia consistent w/ community acquired PNA especially given evidence of left lower lobe infiltrate on Chest X Ray and bandemia.  Less likely that Pt had a Pulmonary embolus since he is therapeutic on coumadin with an INR of 3.0 today, no evidence of RVH on EKG, no chest pain on presentation.  Will treat with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  Will support with albuterol inhaler treatment prn SOB.  Will also continue Pt's outpatient reactive airway disease medication regimen of advair 

2.	h/o PE on Coumadin, INR 3.0 today, will hold Coumadin for tonight since starting Antibiotics.  Will carefully monitor INR.

3.	Tardive dyskinesia: stable, continue outpatient medication regimen

4.	Diabetes Mellitus: will hold Pt's oral hypoglycemic medication while in hospital, will cover w/ ISS

5.	Hypertension: will continue Lisinopril

6.	FEN: Will encourage PO intake as tolerated.  Pt w/ increased Cr likely secondary to slight dehydration.  Will follow closely along w/ electrolyte panel.  Will adjust electrolytes accordingly.  Will start Pt on a diet w/ low saturated fat and low cholesterol.

RE:  Peter Joshi

     MR #453-39-84-4

 

Dear Dr. Craft:

 

I had the pleasure of meeting Peter Joshi in the Cardiology Clinic on February 24th.  Mr. Joshi presents with a complaint

of dyspnea and oxygen requirement.  The patient does relate that

he has had breathing problems in the past and in fact, markedly

worse several years ago.  However, with the treatment of his

coronary artery disease, he had been doing somewhat better until

he underwent surgery for a carotid artery stenosis.  Since that

surgery several months ago, he has had a prolonged period of time

during which he has required supplemental oxygen.  At the same

time, the patient is being treated for congestive heart failure

and in fact, has had a recent increase in his dose of standing

Lasix.  The patient relates that during his hospitalization, he

did have what sounds like a pleural effusion, which a physician

did try to drain, however, unsuccessfully.  At the current time,

Mr. Joshi is feeling slowly better and feels as though he is

able to take a deep breath, which he was unable to do several

months ago.  In fact, he was told recently that he does not need

supplemental oxygen.  He denies a chronic cough, although he does

occasionally have some difficulty swallowing which leads to

coughing.

 

His past medical history includes diabetes, carotid artery

stenosis, coronary artery disease with both angioplasty and stent

placement, congestive heart failure, bladder cancer,

hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux, and

upper GI bleed.

 

 

RE:  Peter Joshi

     MR #453-39-84-4                -2-                 02/24/70

 

His medications include aspirin, Lasix, Isordil, Zestril,

Lopressor, simvastatin, Norvasc, Prevacid, a multi vitamin,

potassium, albuterol, Atrovent, Serevent, and insulin.

 

He has no known drug allergies.  He discontinued cigarette

smoking years ago.

 

On exam today, he had a blood pressure of 122/60.  His pulse was

56, afebrile.  O2 sat on room air initially was at 90%, but when

I rechecked it, it was 95%.  His weight was 221 lbs.  He is in no

respiratory distress at rest.  His oropharynx had dry mucosa and

a somewhat small posterior pharyngeal air space.  His neck had no

enlarged lymph nodes.  Chest had diminished breath sounds in the

left base with crackles.  His right lung was clear.  His heart

was in a regular bradycardic rhythm with a II/III systolic

murmur.  His abdomen was protuberant, but benign.  His

extremities are with 1+ pitting edema and no clubbing.  Pulmonary

function testing had been performed in December and was repeated

again today, which demonstrates that he has a combined

restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect.  His current

vital capacity was improved approximately 10% from that of

December.  He has no bronchodilator response.  I took Mr. Joshi

for a short walk and he never desaturated below 92% and that

includes after walking up one flight of stairs.

 

In summary, I believe that Mr. Joshi has dyspnea which is likely

mostly related to congestive heart failure and deconditioning. 

However, I do believe he might have a pleural effusion based on

my exam and based on his history and therefore, I have referred

him to have a decubitus chest film taken.  Mr. Joshi had several

questions related to his metered dose inhaler use and I have

recommended that he use only Combivent 4x a day regularly.  I do

not believe there is any benefit to be gained from an inhaled

corticosteroid for this gentleman.  I do recommend that he get

daily exercise.  He certainly needs to continue his diuresis and

I will certainly check his chest x-ray on the outside chance that

he may benefit from            a pleural effusion.  I have also

confirmed to him that he no longer requires supplemental oxygen. 

His pulmonary function testing also had demonstrated a reduced

defusion capacity, however, it does correct when accounting for

albuterol volume and therefore do not believe that he is likely

to have either an interstitial lung disease or pulmonary

vascular disease.  However, we will certainly reassess this after

his initial work-up.  Thank you for referring this interesting

patient.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to

call.

 

 

 

Sincerely,

OFFICE VISIT (CHC)
The patient is seen in followup at the Community Health.  He came back from Pennsylvania after being there about a month.  He has had an eventful past six months.  In October, he apparently had a TIA or small stroke.  He was evaluated with an MRA of his neck and was told that there was not enough blockage to warrant surgery.  His symptomatology fortunately clear.  His symptoms were related to loss of feeling in his right upper extremity.  About this time, he also developed a traumatic lesion of the left second toe.  He apparently develops some cellulitis and was treated with ampicillin.  Not long after this, he went into renal failure.  He was told that they could not tell if that was due to the antibiotics or the gadolinium.  According to the patient and his wife, his creatinine went as high as 9.  Fortunately, it is currently back down to 2.4.


His toe lesion has been very slow to improve.  He describes pain in the toe and often has to sleep in a chair with his foot dependent.  He has seen various physicians and podiatrists in Pennsylvania, without much improvement.  They finally told him, he would do well to come back here for further care and evaluation.


On examination today, I can feel femoral and popiteal pulses.  I do not feel any definite pedal pulses on either side but noninvasive study show good pulsatile flow at the calf and transmetatarsal level.  Resting ABI is good, although his diabetic calcinosis probably makes this unreliable.  He has some slight pulsatile flow at the right toe level and flat tracings at left toes.  He has 1 cm escharover the dorsum of his second toe.  There is some erythema of the toe and proximal dorsal forefoot.  This certainly has the appearance of some cellulites.  There is minimal to no swelling of the toe.


We will place him on Keflex 250 mg q.i.d. for 7 to 10 days to see if this helps with any possible associated cellulitis.  I will refer him to Dr. Caldwell for recommendations regarding wound quick care and an opinion whether or not hyperbaric oxygen therapy might be worth considering.  I do not think there is anything further we can do to improve his distal blood flow.  Further imaging will also be very difficult in view of the possible problems with gadolinium as well as his creatinine, which limit contrast administration.  His noninvasive studies suggest that his problems are all diabetic small vessel disease and it is unlikely that we could be of benefit with this.  I will await Dr. Caldwell&#8217;s opinions.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Zastrow is a 67-year-old woman with type I diabetes who comes in today for followup.  We have had heron the insulin pump now for close to six months and recently she had had continuous blood glucose monitoring.  We had gone over these results over the phone and I had made some adjustments.  Particularly she seems to have some late morning hyperglycemia and we decided to change her carbohydrate to bolus ratio during the morning hours and this has resulted in tremendous improvement in her blood sugars.  She brings them in today and the results look excellent.  She has had no other concerns of late.  We have not tested her hemoglobin A1c in a long period of time, so she comes in today for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for the type I diabetes as described, her pernicious anemia, C6-C7 vertebral degenerative disease, pulmonary embolus and also some mild asthma in the past.

Abdominal exam:  Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly or abdominal masses noted.  Anoscopy did not reveal any hemorrhoids.  Neck exam reveals no jugular venous distention.  Carotids are 2+ with normal upstrokes.  Thyroid is 20 g without nodules.  Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neurologically, she is alert and oriented x3 and has a grossly nonfocal exam.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Ms. Zastrow is a 67-year-old woman who comes in today with review of her type 1 diabetes.  She is doing much better on the pump than she was before especially with the recent adjustments we made.  We will continue with the pump and she will continue to send me her blood sugars every two weeks until we get this under control.  We will check a hemoglobin A1c today.  She is up-to-date with the remainder of her health maintenance including seeing a podiatrist and an ophthalmologist as we had prescribed.
2.  Cardiovascular.  She is doing well on her current regimen.  She is on ranolazine and will continue with this.
3.  Neck pain.  Intermittent neck pain is most likely from degenerative disease.  I did not find anything on neurological exam that was concerning.  I did encourage her to actually take some Naprosyn as needed for this pain, but not to take it on a continuous basis for long periods of time.  She has had some problems with some blood in the stool and I feel that she is due for colonoscopy.  I did recommend that she get one in the near future.  

ADDENDUM:  A pelvic exam was with normal appearing female external genitalia.  Normal vaginal vault, no adnexal fullness felt.  Vaginal Pap was taken.  Greater than 50% of our 60-minute visit was spent going over her pump settings, the appropriate levels for her pump, going over her diet, going over her bowel habits and her etiology of possible blood in her stool.

which he has noted that he has been having repeated exertional

dyspnea over the past several days, worsening today when he had

diaphoresis accompanying with no chest pain but felt confused and

did not know where he is supposed to be going in the building until

he was overhead paged to report to specific room, when he looked

up 25 minutes had gone by and he was unaware of what had happened

during that time.  He has had some mild upper respiratory tract

infection about a week ago.  No nausea, no vomiting, no

dizziness, no abdominal pain, and the patient states that he is

feeling much better while he was being given some oxygen but just

feels like he has no energy.  The patient had a cardiac

catheterization in December of 2081 and had a luminal

irregularities and 30% stenosis and echocardiogram revealed 55%

ejection fraction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has history of coronary

disease, MI, and hypercholesterolemia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Smoked in the past for 30 years.  He is a

Senior Manager of Broadcasting by occupation.  Lives with his family.

well-nourished male in mild distress.  Temperature 96.6, pulse

100, respirations 20, blood pressure 164/86.  Lungs clear. 

Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen is flat,

nondistended, bowel sounds normoactive, nontender, no pedal

edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 7.9, electrolytes are normal,

hematocrit 36.  CK was elevated at 657, troponin was negative. 

The patient's D-dimer was 211 and an EKG showed T-wave inversions

in aVL, V5 and V6 which ________ from previous chest x-ray was

negative.

DIAGNOSIS:  Acute coronary syndrome, rule out myocardial

infarction.

CC: 	 SOB

HPI: 	Mr. Isenberg is an 82-year-old male with a past history significant for HTN, DM, CRI, COPD, and BPH.  He recently underwent a two vessel CABG in April 2064. At that time he had presented to HCC in CHF and w/ an NSTEMI. Cardiac catheterization revealed severe disease in the LAD and LCx territory and moderate disease in the RCA. He underwent CABG on 03/31/2064, off-pump, w/ a LIMA to the LAD graft and an SVG to the circumflex OM. His post-operative course was uncomplicated.
He presented to DSH on 8/14 w/ SOB, found to be in CHF (BNP 482). He denies any chest pain and at DSH he had no ischemic EKG changes but was found to have positive cardiac biomarker w/ an initial TnI of 0.6 rising to 23.8 o/n. His biomarkers continue to rise and on transfer were CK 745 and CK-MB of 80.3 with a fraction of 10.7%. He was transferred to HCC where he underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated continued severe disease in his native vessels as well as significant stenosis of his LIMA at its touch-down and complete occlusion of his SVG. A PA line and an IABP were placed and the patient was transferred to the CCU for further management.

MITRAL VALVE

There is evidence of thickening of the anterior mitral leaflet.  There is

calcification of the anterior and posterior mitral annulus.  There is no

evidence of mitral valve prolapse.  The peak transmitral gradient is 10 mmHg.

The mean transmitral gradient is 5 mmHg.  There is mild to moderate mitral

regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler.

LEFT ATRIUM

The left atrium is dilated.



AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT

Multiple aortic leaflets are thickened but there is no stenosis.  The aortic

valve is tricuspid.  There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or

spectral Doppler.



LEFT VENTRICLE

The left ventricular cavity size is normal.  The left ventricular systolic

function approaches the lower limits of normal.  There is symmetric left

ventricular hypertrophy.  There is segmental apical left ventricular

dysfunction (see wall motion plot).  There is no evidence of left ventricular

thrombus.  The estimated ejection fraction is 51 %.



TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC

There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency.



RIGHT VENTRICLE

The right ventricle is not dilated.  The right ventricular systolic function

is within normal limits.



PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES

There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.  There is a space between

visceral and parietal pericardium most c/w pericardial fat.



CONCLUSIONS

Compared to the study of 9/12/73, the EF has dropped by 10% and apical wall

motion abnormalities are now noted.





CCU Course/Plan	

72 year old woman with ESRD, positive troponin in setting SOB and pulmonary oedema on CXR. Suspect  leak  from demand.  



1)	ischemia: ASA, BB. Would doubt she needs urgent cath but will hold NPO for potential cath in am.  Would not add heparin. Check fasting lipids.



2)	rhythm: so far not an issue. BB as tolerated. 



3)	pump: she has LVH and likely diastolic dysfunction.  Would prefer to have ACE on board - will d/w renal as to why not.



4)	ESRD - can go for HD today. Need to contact dialysis unit to arrange time.



5)	DM 2 - SSI for now, will likely give back Lantus tonight. She is v reluctant to have SSI, will give at half usual doses.



6)	FEN cardiac, diabetic diet. Hold NPO pending possible cath in am.



7)	Prophylaxis: GI: Nexium, DVT: Heparin IV; BM: prn. 



8)	Dispo - to SDU today

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:
Richard L. Mckenzie, M.D.
San Luis Obispo County General Hospital
123 Pittsburg Street, Euite 598
Baxter Springs, MO  64715

HISTORY:  Mr. Ehlers is referred for evaluation of extensive coronary disease status.  He has history of several risk factors and a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and a history of cigarette smoking. He has a prior history of peripheral arterial disease with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He also has a history of bicuspid aortic valve with mild-to-moderate stenosis on recent echos and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  

He is status post a posterolateral MI in 2084 and had an adenosine MIBI in January 2097 with an old inferior MI and peri-infarct ischemia.  He presented with increasing angina with exertion where he is able to do most activities and climb stairs and walk his dog, but does have about one episode of angina a week while raking leaves that last about 5 minutes and resolves with rest.  He has not had any rest pain.  For his increasing angina, he had an attempted cardiac catheterization done last month, but they are unable to advance the guidewire pass the iliac artery and an MRI was able to determine that he has an occluded aorta.  He then had a left brachial artery.  Cardiac catheterization that revealed extensive coronary disease with a 70-80% distal left main stenosis and severe disease of the LAD and circumflex with minimal flow and a subtotal occlusion of the proximal right coronary with collateralization from the LAD territory.  There was an anomalous circumflex that appeared to emerge from the right coronary and there was a question of his anomalus LAD with a separate ostium superior to the left main, but the documentation of this was not clear.  With the complexity of his anatomy, he is referred for further evaluation.  He has otherwise a history of cigarette smoking and quit three months ago, does not drink alcohol.  He is married and lives in Missouri.

MEDICATIONS:  His baseline medicines include aspirin 81 mg a day, has included warfarin, ramipril 10 mg a day, Lopressor 50 mg twice a day, Lipitor 80 mg a day and Zetia 10 mg a day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A well-appearing man in no acute distress.  Blood pressure of 128/60, pulse of 60-70 and room air sat of 99%.  He had no jugular venous distention.  Chest was clear.  Heart had normal S1 and S2.  No S3 or S4.  There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border.  His abdomen was benign.  Extremities showed no peripheral edema, but very faint distal pulses that were audible by Doppler.

IMAGING STUDIES:  His electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left anterior fascicular block and was otherwise unremarkable.  His labs showed a BUN/creatinine of 21/1.3, glucose 145 and hematocrit of 40%.

IMPRESSION:  Mr. Ehlers presents with extensive vascular disease including left main and three-vessel disease.  We will try and define better his actual anatomy and likely do act angiogram to try and identify the locations of any anomalus vessels and then have a surgical consults regarding bypass surgery for his left main extensive disease.  We will also get an echocardiogram to reevaluate carefully the aortic valve.  We will also likely consult the vascular surgeons to discuss management of the occluded aorta.

CC:  73 yo woman admitted with recurrent hypotension preventing hemodialysis



HPI:  Putting together Ms. Falon's story from her personal history, she has had type 2 diabetes for many years and is now suffering from many of the complications of that disease, including retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy. This lead to ESRD and hemodialysis starting 18 months ago, using a left forearm AV fistula that recently required catheter based intervention after clogging for a second time. Also related, at least in part, to her diabetic disease is coronary artery disease leading to a non-ST elevation MI in December 2074. Since then she has had bouts of what appears to be her anginal equivalent- left ear pain and a sense of fullness in her lower chest that occur at rest and are fleeting, going away before she has time to try a SLTNG. In addition, Ms. Fallon states that her blood pressures have run much lower, on occasion preventing the removal of fluid during dialysis, which leaves her edematous and more fatigued than normal. She is on a STTh HD schedule, but came to the EW four nights ago with hypotension in the setting of HD. She did not go to HD today, as her SBP was again too low.  Using a home machine, Ms. Fallon recorded SBPs in the 80's and complains of frequent periods of dizziness, especially when getting up from the seated position. She is unable to lie flat 2/2 to orthopnea. She denies recent fevers, chills, SOB or chest pain. Lower extremity swelling continues to be a problem and she is complaining of left heel pain.



PMH: ESRD as a result of DM on HD, DM related retinopathy/neuropathy; h/o infected tunneled catheter; hyperparathyroidism; HTN in the past; CAD s/p NSTEMI 12/74, echo in Jan 2074 showed EF 52%; CHF;  PVD with RLE ulcer followed by Dr. Archer; h/o  GI bleed with negative upper endoscopy , pending colonoscopy, umbilical and hiatal hernia, cervical CA 6 years ago s/p hysterectomy; gout; benign breast tumor; h/o DVT s/p filter placement; h/ hypercalcemia, depression

Alternative meds: None

Allergies: MSO4 cause SOB; Novocaine causes seizure



Family history: Non-contributory



Social history: Lives at home with husband of 34 years, two children from previous marriage live in the area, has grandchildren. Used to work in construction.



Risks: Never use tobacco, rarely used alcohol, no injection drug use



Review of systems: (+) some vaginal blood spotting recently. No recent HA, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, cough, sputum production, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, abdominal pain.

RE:  Michael Isenberg

HCC# - 367-41-93



Dear Dr. Uher:



I saw our mutual patient, Mr. Isenberg, today in my office for a routine followup wound check.  As you know, this is an 81 year-old man with a history of chronic renal insufficiency and diabetes.  He underwent an off-pump double bypass on 3/31/64.  He had an excellent post-operative recovery being discharged on day five.  Since home, he reports having no further symptoms of shortness of breath or chest pain.  He has been gradually increasing his daily activity and is now walking about five to ten minutes a day and two flights of steps.  I have suggested that he gradually increase his daily exercise.



On examination today his heart rate was 80 and regular.  His chest incision was well healed and his sternum stable.  His lungs were clear bilaterally.  He had mild edema at his right ankle and a well-healed endoscopic vein harvest site.  His current medications are aspirin 325 a day, Nexium 20 a day, Lisinopril 2.5 a day, Atenolol 25 a day, Plavix 75 a day, Glimepiride 1 mg. PO b.i.d., and Lipitor 80 mg. a day.



Overall, I am obviously delighted to see Mr. Isenberg having recovered without complication from his revascularization.  I trust that you have received a copy of his Discharge Summary previously.  If not please let me know and we   ll forward you this.  Thanks for letting us participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman and let me know if I can be of further assistance.



Sincerely,

Urology Consult Note


Patient Name:  Michael Yee
PH#:  69044681
Date/Time:  12/24/94; 2:30 PM
Attending:  Dr. Quintrell Ferreira


CC:          presumed UTI in the setting of indwelling B ureteral stents


HPI:          77M w/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction (diagnosed 10/93 in the setting of B hydroureteronephrosis and ARF) managed initially with B ureteral stents (most recently changed 2/26/94), currently admitted to the medical service 12/23/94 with FTT, anemia, hyperkalemia, and a presumed UTI.


He was brought to the PH ED yesterday by his wife, who noted that he was lethargic and confused for 3 days (reportedly similar to previous UTI presentations).  She felt that his urine output had decreased at home, and that his urine had been foul-smelling for two days.  He was treated empirically with levofloxacin and transfused 2U PRBC for HCT 26.  His Cr was elevated at 3.1, and his K was 6.4.  He was admitted to a telemetry bed on the medical service for management of the above issues.  The patient has been hemodynamically stable, and his only subjective complaint has been general malaise.


We are consulted with the question of whether his stents may be changed during his current admission.


PMH:        Duchenne&#8217;s muscular dystrophy, COPD (2.5L home O2), IDDM, recurrent UTIs w/ previous Candida tropicalis fungemia (followed by Dr. Phoebe Abreu), B ureteral obstruction s/p ureteral stent placement, CAD s/p CABG, PVD, SZ disorder, hyperkalemia secondary to hyperaldosteronemia (type III RTA), CRI (baseline 1.5)

RADS:     CT A/P W/O CONTRAST &#8211; pending


A/P:  77M w/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction, now admitted w/ ARF, hyperkalemia, anemia, and a presumed UTI.  His U/A and UCx are not overwhelmingly c/w a UTI, but his clinical presentation was reportedly similar to prior UTI presentations.  He is being managed by ID.  His ureteral stents were last changed 2/94, but he has never obtained a diagnosis for his B ureteral obstruction.  His abdominal CT is pending.  He remains clinically stable, with significantly improved cognition and awareness since admission.  As such, we recommend:
--F/U UCx and ID recs, as you are doing.
--F/U CT A/P to assess for recurrent hydronephrosis.  Depending on the results of this study, we will consider ureteral stent change vs. staged removal.  Regardless of his eventual stent plan, he should be medically cleared for an operative procedure, which would entail stabilization of his hyperkalemia prior to undergoing anaesthesia.


D/w Dr. Ferreira, who agrees with above plan.  Thank you for allowing us to continue our involvement in the care of this unfortunate patient.

a deep venous thrombosis of the left leg extending from the calf 
into the common femoral vein which is being treated now with 
Coumadin, but today he noticed the redness, swelling and pain in 
the leg.  Please see the resident's hand written record for 
explicit details of the patient's visit and findings. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Please see the resident's hand written record 
for explicit details of the patient's visit and findings. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Please see the resident's hand written 
record for explicit details of the patient's visit and findings. 
MEDICATIONS:  Please see the resident's hand written record for 
explicit details of the patient's visit and findings.

explicit details of the patient's visit and findings. 
SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  Please see the resident's hand 
written record for explicit details of the patient's visit and 
findings. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, about one half the 
area of the distal leg more anteriorly is warm, red, discolored and 
tender.  Homan's sign is negative. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was sent for Doppler 
ultrasound of the leg which showed improved flow through the common 
femoral vein, but persistent thrombosis in the superficial femoral 
of the gastrocnemius and popliteal veins.  He was begun on 
intravenous Nebcin for a presumed cellulitis.  The plan is several 
days of hospitalization with elevation and intravenous antibiotics. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Cellulitis of leg. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 
admitted to the hospital in fair condition.

Imaging:

Vascular studies done today, OSH: 
patent right femoral to popliteal artery bypass graft with markedly reduced flow, toe-brachial index 0.0 &#8211; confirmed with PVR in UMH ED



Assessment/Plan:
 

The patient is an 74 yo male with a history of CAD, PVD, s/p right femoral to above knee popliteal bypass graft who presents with progressive R foot claudication X 2 weeks.  His vascular studies are concerning for progressive arterial ischemia, presumably the result of graft stenosis. 



He will be admitted to the vascular surgery service, be placed on systemic heparin, and will undergo angiogram in the next 1-2 days for possible angioplasty/stent.



Plan:

-          Systemic anticoagulation w/ IV heparin, bolus 3000 units followed by drip at 1000 units/hr

-          Home meds

-          NPO past midnight

-          Mucormyst/bicarbonate for renal protection given creatinine 1.99

-          Plan for likely angiogram tomorrow, 8/12/05



This patient was discussed with Dr. Francis Pratt, Vascular Surgery Fellow.

MR# 6691247

Date of Admission: 8/24/91

GI:  Narvaez, Guy

PCP: Suzanne, Otto



ID/CC:	Weakness 



HPI:  Mr. Wood is a 58 yo M w/ Hx of colonic polyps and diverticulosis who presents with 1 day of weakness.  Mr. Wood was at work this morning and at 9 AM he started to feel weak.  He describes the weakness as lack of energy and has normal muscle strength.  He states he really didn't have any symptoms other than weakness, but when asked about chest pain, he notes that he had mild chest discomfort, which was analogous to catching his breath after exercise.  He also describes some mild lightheadedness.  He has 2 pillow orthopnea, but he denies any fever, chills, nausea, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, syncope, HA, dyspnea, chest pain, PND, diaphoresis, palpitations, or any other concerning symptoms.  He notes his last BM was on Friday morning and states his stools have not been black or tarry, bright red, pencil thin, or watery.  He denies any abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea.  He notes that rest and staying out of the heat improved his symptoms, while exertion worsened his symptoms.  He has had these symptoms before in March of this year, but his symptoms today are more mild than when he presented then.  At that time he had symptoms of weakness and lightheadedness especially when standing, and he was found to have a Hct of 24.9.  He was guiac positive and was sent for a colonoscopy and an upper GI endoscopy, where a he was found to have erosive esophagitis and two cecal polyps.  The bowel prep on the colonoscopy was poor and he was asked to follow up with a repeat colonoscopy.  He was sent home on iron supplements and a PPI.  Of note, his previous colonoscopies had shown tubulovillous adenomas including a 25 mm polyp that could not be fully resected and had been   Before this admission he was seen by his worksite nurse who sent him to his PCP.  Dr. David Napolitano at Kessel Group Home saw him and transferred him to SMI for workup of severe anemia (Hct 25.4 MCV 75), dizziness, and orthostasis.

EKG:   Normal sinus rhythm.  Axis at 0.  No Q waves or ST changes

ER Course:  In the ER, he was started on IVFs and labs were sent.



Impression:  



Mr. Wood is a 58 yo M w/ Hx of colonic polyps and diverticulosis who presents with 1 day of weakness and lightheadedness secondary to a microcytic anemia.  His Hct stabilized at 26 since his transfer from his PCP's office.  His anemia is most likely due to lower GI bleeding from either his diverticulosis or from his polyposis given his guiac positive stool in the ER.  He is currently hemodynamically stable and he states he feels much better symptomatically.  Given that he hasn't had a follow up colonoscopy since the poorly prepped one in March of this year, he will probably need to be reevaluated by Dr. Narvaez.  Other possible attributing causes of his anemia could be hypothyroidism given his somewhat delayed response, but his DTR were normal.  Iron studies will be sent to confirm the probable diagnosis of chronic GI bleeding resulting in iron deficiency anemia.  He will not be transfused now given that he is asymptomatic currently and he prefers not to be transfused unless necessary.  His syncope could also have been exacerbated from his slight orthostatic hypotension as seen on PE and his high Cre and BUN indicating that he is volume depleted.  He will be adequately hydrated to correct his hypotension.  Given his chest pain and syncope, MI will be ruled out, but this is very unlikely given his clinical presentation.  His first enzymes were negative and his EKG showed no Q waves or ST changes.   



Plan: 

1)	GI Bleed

a.	Transfuse pRBCs if necessary - Consent and Type and Cross (O +)

b.	Two large bore IVs if rapid resuscitation is needed

c.	Follow Hct Q8H and watch HR and BP for signs of active bleeding

d.	Nexium 40 POQD

2)	Heme:  Anemia

a.	Send Iron Studies, TSH

b.	FeSO4 325 mg POTID

3)	CV:  

a.	Rule out MI:  Enzymes + Monitor

b.	Hypertensive:  Continue on HCTZ and Zestril

c.	Hyperlipidemia:  Continue Lipitor

RE: Benitez, Wonda
MR: 89276954
 
Dear Usha:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients, Ms.
Wonda Benitez, in my cardiovascular clinic for follow-up status
post coronary artery bypass surgery and pounding headaches.  As you
know, we performed a persantine MIBI recently which showed inferior
wall ischemia.  I wasn't sure whether or not this ischemia was new. 
On review of her coronary artery bypass surgery notes, she did not
have her totally occluded right coronary artery bypass.  Therefore,
I suggest that this reversible ischemia in the inferior wall is
probably old and was the result of the fact that they did not
bypass this area.  She did have a LIMA to the LAD and two saphenous
venous grafts to the circumflex territory, the OM and the diagonal. 
She has been doing relatively well with chest discomfort and I
recommended we continue her current cardiac medications.  However,
she has been complaining of pounding headaches and she did have a
history of otitis media in her right ear.  Therefore, I think it
wouldn't be unreasonable to refer her to ENT to have them evaluate
her ears as a possible source of her pounding headaches.  In the
meantime, I have suggested that she take her nifedipine and
nitroglycerin in the event that her blood pressure shoots up during
these episodes.  I suspect that her blood pressure rise during
these episodes is due more to anxiety than to intrinsic problem
with her cardiovascular system.  She will return to see me in
follow-up in three months time, at which time I will check her
cholesterol level.
 
Again, thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your
patient.  Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any
questions.
 
With warm regards,
 
 
Gordon Q. Iniguez, M.D.

MICROBIOLOGY

Urine culture MEDIQUIK 7/10: &gt;100,000 mixed 3 organisms (contamination)



RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES



Left hip xray (7/13): 
Status post left hip replacement. New bony fragment (since 6/29/77)

     superior to the left femur, likely from the greater trochanter



Left hip CT (7/13):  

1) heterogeneous density 6.6 x 8.9 cm intra-muscular soft tissue collection within the muscle planes in the left supero-lateral aspect of the left hip

2) smaller soft tissue collection within the subcutaneous fat anterolateral to the left hip measuring 4.7 x 7.9 cm

Impression: There at least two soft tissue collections are seen within the soft tissues surrounding the left total hip replacement, which have high density components likely representing hematomas.  The superior lateral collection appears intramuscular.  The inferolateral collection is within the subcutaneous fat.



TTE (6/2077): Mild MR. Left atrium enlarged at 36 mm. Moderate TR with prominent Eustachian valve. Normal LV cavity with EF 64%. Normal RV function with RVSP 44.



EKG

Irregular tachycardia with nml uniform appearing P-waves and narrow QRS; ?atrial tachycardia with variable block versus sinus tachycardia with dropped beats (similar pattern observed on EKG dated 6/29/77)

            

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

87F w h/o HTN, HLP, DM, hypothyroidism, and now 2 weeks s/p left hemiarthroplasty after L femoral neck fracture who p/w fatigue at MEDIQUIK and was found to have an 8.5-point hct drop. 




1) hct drop &#8211; likely post-op hematoma, unlikely other source of bleeding

- follow hct bid

- if pt c/o recurrent pain, or if exam changes, will obtain repeat hip xray

- transfuse if hct shows evidence of active bleeding (hct&lt;28 in AM) and symptomatic

HALL, NICK

65219816

06/14/2097





Primary Care Physician:

Youssef Nall, M.D.

Ludlow Medical Center

10 Wilder St

Post, IN  86454



Dear Dr. Nall:



It was a pleasure to see Nick again in the Internal Medicine at Wytheville South Hospital on 06/14/2098 for routine folow up of radiation associated ischemic heart disease.  


As you know, Nick had mantle radiation in his youth for Hodgkin's lymphoma, and subsequently had 2 NSTEMIs in 2087 and 2090.  He received bare-metal stents to his LAD and RCA and did well until 2094 when after diagnosis and resection of a squamous cell lung carcinoma, his postop course was immediately complicated by an acute inferior STEMI/VT/VF arrest.  Immediate angiography post-resuscitation found massive thrombus burden in his proximal right coronary artery, with good result after thrombectomy and POBA, in addition to Integrilin, aspirin, Plavix, and low dose heparin.  Remarkably, after an IABP and aggressive care Nick walked away with a preserved LV function after this event.  He did well until 01/2095 when he represented with unstable angina and was found to have in-stent restenosis in the ostial LAD and the ostial RCA bare-metal stents.  He was treated with Cypher drug-eluting stents to both lesions (3.5 x 18 mm Cypher stent post dilated to 20 atm to the LAD and 3.5 x 23 mm extending slightly into the sinus of Valsalva to the RCA) with no residual stenosis.  Because of concerns with regards to recurrent in-stent restenosis he was put on dual antiplatelet therapy (325mg ECASA and clopidogrel 150 mg) since that event intended as longterm therapy.  He has been followed by me since 2095 with no recurrent ischemic heart disease, chest pain, and has returned to normal exercise capacity and with preserved cardiac systolic function.  


Nick continues to be very successful as a technology consultant in IBM research in Leland.  As the economy is picking up, his work environment has improved as has his stress level.  He is walking every day both at work and recreationally and lost another 5pounds.  He takes his medications regularly and is usually compliant  but ran out of atenolol last week and instead has been taking bid ramipril in its place.  Every year he asks whether we can down-titrate his clopidogrel both for tolerance and cost reasons (I reassured him that it should be generic within a year).  Nevertheless, we tested the degree of platelet inhibition he currently has with the VerifyNow P2Y12 PRU assay, and his result was 177, which is below the cut-off of 230 PRU thought to approximate adequate platelet inhibition.
  He recently had some transient melena for which he was placed on ranitidine.




His current medications should be aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o. daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily, ramipril 10 mg p.o. daily, atenolol 50 mg p.o. daily, L-thyroxine 125 mcg p.o. daily, ranitidine 150 mg po daily, 1 tablet fish oil daily, and 1 tablet of vitamin D daily. 
He has no known drug allergies.




Physical Examination:  Nick looks well.  He is in no distress. Weight is 221 lbs.  Blood pressure is 150/80 in the right arm repeated over 3 manual measurements with a large manual cuff and his heart rate is 70 and regular.  His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure, normal carotid upstroke and contour with no bruits.  His chest is clear to auscultation.  His cardiovascular exam demonstrated normal left apex and normal first and second heart sounds with a normal splitting of the second heart sound with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.  He had no peripheral edema.  His abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly.  He had 2+ pulses in the peripheral exam.



EKG today demonstrated sinus rhythm at 88 bpm with voltage criteria for LVH, LAE and prior inferior Q-waves.


We are awaiting an updated lipid profile due this week before modifying his lipid therapy which is aimed to target a goal of less than 70 mg/dL.  He has tried and failed a trial of niacin in the past due to intolerable flushing and headache.  His LDL last year was 98 mg/dL though HDL has improved to 37 mg/dL. His TC/HDL ratio is 4.2, his TC is 155 mg/dL, and TG 101 mg/dL.  HbA1c is 7.2%.


The previous echo in 2096 demonstrated normal LV size and function with a normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65% with no signs of LVH.



Impression:  Nick is doing well with CCS 1 symptoms after repeated MIs most recently in 2095 due to accelerated coronary atheroclerosis and radiation stenoses.  


To target his coronary risk factors, I recommended the following:

1.  Should his LDL be &gt;70mg/dL he should switch to rosuvastatin 40mg daily for LDL and HDL improvement.

2.  Given clopidorel platelet reactivity is less than 230 PRU he will decrease to 75 mg daily and we will re-check his PRU activity after at least 7 days on this dose.  Should PRU &gt; 230 he will either need to restart 150 mg daily and take a PPI like pantoprazole or switch to prasugrel (or when available ticagrelor).
3.  He will continue a healthy heart diet and exercise and we will see him again in 6 months.



Thank you for allowing me to participate in his care.  As I am not continuing a general out-patient clinic next year, Nick will transition to another cardiologist who can accomodate his day off from work which is typically on Saturday.  


The patient was discussed in clinic with Dr. Neale Xiao who agreed with this plan.



Yours sincerely,

   Mr. Eubanks is a 68 yo man w/ recently diagnosed CAD s/p LAD stent.



	Interval History:

   Mr Eubanks presents for hospital followup after presenting to BBH in January 2149 w/ after he developed 2 episodes of chest pain lasting 1-2 minutes each and not associated with any symptoms.  On the morning of admission, patient developed more severe chest pain and pressure radiating to both arms and back.  Pain persisted for 2 hours, prompting the patient to present to the BBH ED for further care. In the ED, patient was treated with ASA, metoprolol, sl NTG, and chest pain resolved. EKGs showed biphasic T-waves in V4-5.  CT scan was negative for aortic dissection or other acute pathology.  Cardiac markers were negative.  Patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine service for further management. Of note, at Pennsylvania Hospital, patient had a positive ETTMIBI showing fixed + mild reversible defect in the inferoapical region in 2/47, followed up with normal exercise echo in 5/47.



On first night of admission, patient developed recurrent chest pain when going to the bathroom.  Because of his risk factors for disease, the decision was made to proceed directly to cardiac catheterization. In the cath lab, patient was found to have multivessel CAD with an LAD culprit.  He received 3xCypher stents to the mid and distal LAD with residual flow limitation.  RCA with moderate disease.  LCx with distal disease.  

Patient was transferred to the SDU for further care.He was started on beta-blockers and ace-inhibition, and tolerated these medications well.  He was evaluated for cardiac rehab. Of note, patient was informed of the pulmonary nodule located on CT scan and the need for follow-up CT in 3 months.

Lydia Levine
MR #813-25-60-5
March 20, 2076
 
Ms. Levine is a 50-year-old, perimenopausal woman with non-
insulin dependent diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and a history
of tobacco use, who underwent a recent cardiac catheterization
for a positive stress test.  At catheterization she had a
proximal 60% lesion in her RCA as well as a mid 60-70% RCA
lesion, obtuse marginal lesion of 60%, and an LAD mid lesion of
60%.  At the time it was decided to continue medical therapy on
Ms. Levine.  Since her cardiac catheterization approximately two
weeks ago, she has had no recurrent symptoms of chest pain.  She
continues on her medicines including Lopid 500 mg b.i.d.,
atenolol, aspirin, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed, as
well as her oral hypoglycemic medicines.
 
Physical Examination:  She is an obese, white female in no acute
distress.  Her vital signs are stable.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation.  Cardiac exam reveals regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2; no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  She has no
peripheral edema.
 
Electrocardiogram shows a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 70,
axis of about 46, and there are no acute ST-T changes noted.
 
Impression/Plan:  We will continue Ms. Levine on her current
cardiac regimen.  She has three-vessel coronary artery disease,
non-obstructive in nature.  As long as she remains asymptomatic
on her current medical regimen, we will continue to follow her. 
She will return for a follow-up visit in approximately three
months.

PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:  Opal Lanier, MD


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a complicated 72-year-old woman who has a history significant for porcine aortic valve replacement in January of 2080 at Madison Medical Center for aortic stenosis.  She also has a history of interstitial lung disease, maintained on prednisone slow taper.  She also has hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  She had been residing at a nursing home and complained of chest pain, jaw pain and bilateral shoulder pain for approximately 1 week.  Eventually, the patient was transferred to Wheeling Clinic.  Here in the Emergency Department, the patient was found to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s, which improved to the 90s with volume and blood resuscitation.  She also found to be tachycardic and have a hematocrit of 25%.  The patient was also found to be guaiac positive on stool occult blood.  Her troponin was mildly elevated.  The patient was transfused with several units of packed red blood cells and her chest discomfort has improved.  She also underwent echocardiography on 03/26/80, which was a fair quality study with a mildly dilated left ventricle, mild LVH, septal flattening consistent with RV pressure overload and an estimated ejection fraction of 35% to 40%.  Diastolic dysfunction was also noted.  There was dilatation of both atria and the right ventricle with mildly reduced RV systolic function.  The aortic valve could not be well visualized.  There was reduced cusp excursion with severe aortic stenosis.  There was mild tricuspid regurgitation and estimated PASP of 60 to 65 mmHg plus RA pressure.  There was mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation with a posteriorly directed jet.  The aortic valve peak gradient was 115.6 mmHg and mean gradient was 77.05 mmHg.  Valve area was not calculated.


The patient was transferred to Madison Medical Center for treatment of her symptoms.  She notes that her chest pain has improved.  She notes that she had worsening of her baseline dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath at rest starting in September that has been gradually progressing.  She denies trouble breathing at night.  She also notes peripheral edema that seems worse now than it did back in September.  She denies any fevers, chills or cough.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for porcine aortic valve replacement in 2078, BOOP, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and congestive heart failure.


MEDICATIONS:  Her discharge medications from Wheeling Clinic were prednisone 25 mg p.o. once daily, Humalog insulin sliding scale, metoprolol 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. once daily, Lasix 40 mg p.o. once daily, metolazone 5 mg p.o. once daily, simvastatin 20 mg p.o. once daily, omeprazole 20 mg p.o. once daily, Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. q.8 h. p.r.n., aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily, vitamin D 400 units once daily, oxybutynin 5 mg p.o. once daily, Milk of magnesium p.r.n. and MiraLax p.r.n.


ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and sulfa.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in a nursing home.  She typically ambulates with a walker, though she has become dyspneic even ambulating a few feet.  She quit smoking 40 years ago.  There is no alcohol use.  She has 6 children, all in good health, one of whom is accompanying her and is studying to be a lawyer.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient appears comfortable and is sitting upright in a chair.  Her heart rate is 82 to 96 and regular, blood pressure 150/98, repeat is 126/86, repeat is 110/72, respiratory rate is 20, oxygen saturation 98% on 2 L nasal cannula and temperature 97.6.  JVP is difficult to assess given body habitus.  Lungs exhibit bibasilar crackles one-third of the way up, worse on the left than the right.  Air movement is fair.  There are no carotid bruits.  Carotid upstrokes are markedly diminished and mildly delayed.  On heart exam, PMI could not be felt.  There is a regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 crescendo-decrescendo early to mid systolic peaking murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border radiating across the precordium.  There are no rubs or gallops.  Extremities show no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  There is moderate pedal edema bilaterally going up to the ankles.


EKG shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 87 beats per minute, left atrial enlargement, LVH by voltage with secondary ST and T-wave changes, but what appeared to be primary T-wave inversions in leads V3 to V6 consistent with ischemia and these changes are more dramatic than they were back on 03/03/78 EKG.


Lab testing reveals normal sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, BUN, creatinine and glucose.  Magnesium and calcium were normal.  Albumin is low at 2.6.  Liver function tests are normal.  Creatinine kinase is 15, troponin is 0.7 and B-natriuretic peptide is 2510.  Thyroid studies are pending.  Hemoglobin A1c is 5.7.  CBC shows mild anemia with hematocrit of 35.8% with normal hemoglobin of 12.2, elevated white count at 13.32 and platelet count of 305,000.  Coagulation studies are normal.


IMPRESSION:  A 72-year-old woman with congestive heart failure, recent echocardiogram suggesting severe aortic stenosis and her bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement for AS back in 2080 and GI bleed with significant anemia, now transfused and improved.  The patient also has chronic interstitial lung disease for which she is on chronic steroid therapy.


I think the main issue is to determine whether there is significant aortic stenosis that may require re-intervention.  On exam, most features are not consistent with severe aortic stenosis, so we will repeat the echocardiogram here and determine if there is severe aortic stenosis in the bioprosthetic valve, and if so, what is the pathology.  Depending on this, we will determine whether the patient needs surgical reoperation.  If so, she will need to have her GI tract looked that first for the source of GI bleeding in order to treat this in preparation for repeat cardiac surgery.


In addition, the patient will be treated for congestive heart failure with increased diuretics, following her inputs and outputs, daily weights, basal metabolic panel, exam and chest x-ray.  Her beta-blocker will be increased due to her recent myocardial event, keeping an eye on her CHF in order to not worsen it.  Beta-blocker will be gradually increased given the lung disease and congestive heart failure. Endocarditis will be ruled out with serial blood cultures.

                                              8-30-75
 
 
 
HPI:  Ms. Stephenson is a 57-year old woman who has a history of multinodular 
goiter status post a hemithyroidectomy 7 years ago, and 
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years complicated 
by diabetic retinopathy.  She also has had a TAH and is on Premarin 
replacement.  She has had only one prior visit in Internal Medicine one year ago with 
Dr. Eric Olds, and since then has been seen for med refills by nurse 
practitioners.  She has had no specific complaints, has been relatively 
compliant with her medicines although her understanding of her disease 
process appears to be limited.  She currently is taking Micronase 10 mg. a 
day, an aspirin a day, and Premarin .625 mg. a day.  She describes 
intermittent symptoms of hyperglycemia, although she follows her blood 
sugars with urine dipsticks and says that they have been running in the 
non-detected range most often.  She has not had any new visual blurring, 
excessive polydipsia or polyuria.  She has not been taking her Synthroid 
medication for the past year since she last saw Dr. Olds, since she ran out 
of the medication.  She has made no effort to get a refill on this, and 
has not noticed any significant difference.  She denies excessive fatigue, 
palpitations, constipation, or lethargy, yet she inquires today about 
potentially restarting this medicine.  She has no other specific 
complaints.  She has a good energy level.
 
Social History:  She works at Nvidia and lives with her son.
 
Allergies:  None.
 
Habits:  She does not drink.  She had quit smoking a year ago, but has 
been smoking this past week due to some stresses at home, and is planning 
on stopping this.
 
Physical Exam:  Blood pressure 148/83.  Pulse 70 and regular.  HEENT exam 
reveals a palpable right thyroid lobe and an absent left thyroid lobe 
without specific nodularity or tenderness.  She has no adenopathy.  Her 
oropharynx is clear.  Her chest is clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam:  
regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, without murmurs or rubs.  Her abdomen is 
obese, soft and non-tender.  She has abnormal pigmentation across her 
skin, including her palms and her soles of her feet, and no peripheral 
edema.
 
Assessment/Plan:
 
1)   Diabetes mellitus.  Will continue on Micronase 10 mg. a day, check a 
     hemoglobin A1C, and send her to the eye doctor.  We have talked about 
     good foot hygiene, and she will continue to check her urine 
     dipsticks.  
 
2)   History of multinodular goiter. I will send a TSH today to assess her

3)   Routine health screening.  She does not need a pap smear.  She has 
     had a TAH; however, I will perform a mammogram on her today.  She 
     will come back and see me in one month to get the results of these 
     tests, and we will make treatment decisions at that time.

Reports that her control has not been good and does not have records.
No severe hypoglycemia.
Retinopathy:	Still has not seen Dr. Aragon. No subjective change in visual acuity.
Nephropathy:	Cr 1.7 in January. Has not seen transplant MDs in a couple of years. Formerly saw Dr. Hayes. 
Neuropathy:	No foot discomfort.
Cardiac:	Has occasional high substernal chest tightness, every couple of weeks, over about 6 months, unrelated to exercise. Can last up to 15 minutes. Has not become more frequent. Sees Dr. Dotson annually. Has sensation about weekly that she cannot swallow, liquids>solids. Has had this for over a year and it has not been progressive.  
Vascular:	No claudication.

Past Medical History: 
Medications: wants to reduce costs     asks about generics for Lipitor, transplant meds. 

Family History: 
Wendee has been profiled in the media because of her work as an industrial engineer 

Social History: 
Jake is well. His parents have been ill. 

Review of Systems: above
Psych: Referred to urologist at KJH, Dr. Xayachack (? sp) because of absent libido. He made the switch from Celexa to Wellbutrin and added Androgel and DHEA. She has noted more acne or no more libido. The loss of libido precedes the Celexa and the possibility of its relationship to Neoral or CellCept has been raised. 
She sees her gynecologist regularly.

Physical Exam:	
Looks remarkably well.
BP:   160/98   170/88		P:   60, regular	
Wt:   153 without shoes, down 15

Extremities:	No edema.  Pedal pulses all 1-2+ except L PT not palpable.           Small blister, resolving L 5th toe. Small crust L medial malleolus. 

Impressions and Plan:	
Hard to assess control without data. Hopefully her weight loss does not reflect terrible control.
BP much too high. Start Toprol 25 mg qd.
I have no objection to switch to simvastatin from atorvastatin for  cost reasons, but she must check with the transplant MDs re: this switch because of Neoral interaction with statins.
Her chest pain does not sound particularly cardiac but will ask Dr. Dotson whether he wants any further evaluation. 
MUST     see Dr. Aragon, see transplant MD. Make these appointments for her today.
Will get barium swallow because of her dysphagia - ? disorganized esophageal contractions; consider manometry with Dr. Quam.
A1c, Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine, Ca, P, A/G, 25-(OH) vitamin D, PTH, CBC, urinalysis. Has already taken her Neoral today.
Fasting lipids another day.

A/P)
SOB: 
Very high pulm pressures with dilated pulmonary arteries especially in comparison to prior echos in the setting of sudden onset SOB and LE edema in a patient who is sedentary and has had thrombotic events in the past makes PE a likely possibility.  Her poorly controlled HTN, LE edema and rales 
make flash pulmonary edema another consideration.  
Despite her lack of a significant smoking history she had emphasematous changes on prior chest CT scans 
and so could be at risk for a COPD exacerbation but she had good air movement w/o wheezes.  Her face appears slightly swollen and she has had SVC syndrome in the past but her facial swelling is likely related to her steroids, she has only mild venous distention on her chest and she claims her fascial swelling is not worse then usual.
&#224;Agree w/ lasix 60 mg iv BID (but pt may be preload dependent w/ such severe pulm htn so we have to avoid volume depleting her)
&#224;V/Q scan and LE dopplers
&#224;If no PE and not better w/ lasix then will need to consider chest CT w/ IV contrast to r/o SVC syndrome and parechymal lund problems.
&#224;When pt feeling better I would check full PFTS to evaluate pulm htn and possibility of COPD.  I would also screen her for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency given the emphysematous changes on prior CT.


RENAL TX:  Cr only mildly above baseline.  Hopefully won&#8217;t worsen w/ lasix.
&#224;check prograf trough
&#224;continue prograf, cellcept, prednisone at usual doses
&#224;given LE edema check uprot/ucr ratio


HTN:  Poorly controlled.  It&#8217;s partly worsenend by her anxiety.
&#224;ativan 0.5 mg iv q 8 hrs prn anxiety
&#224;Labetolol 20 mg IV and start labetolol 100 mg po bid (bblocker effect will slow HR and help flash pulm edema from diastolic dyfct, the combined alpha and beta blockade will give it added efficacy given the severity of her HTN, Norvasc may not be ideal given her LE edema).


???DM:  pt on metformin for &#8220;diabetes prevention.&#8221;  Metformin is contraindicated for Cr greater then or equal to 1.4 in a female pt.
&#224;d/c metformin


H/O METABOLIC ACIDOSIS:  Pt on chronic bicarb likely to her baseline mild allograft dysfct.  This can be a sodium load that can worsen her pulm edema.

RE:Etheridge, Shari

PMH:94482315

 

July 13, 2087

 

REASON FOR VISIT:  Postoperative appointment.

 

HPI:  Shari is an 83-year-old female who on March 21, 2087 underwent an 

ileocecectomy for ischemic bowel.  Two weeks prior to her presentation 

to the Parkview Memorial Hospital she underwent a stent placement to 

her SMA.  After stent placement she was discharged to rehab, and then 

returned to the emergency room complaining of severe sudden onset of 

right lower quadrant pain.  CT scan of the abdomen showed cecal 

thickening with fat stranding locally.  She subsequently was taken to 

the operating room.  Her postoperative course was uncomplicated and she 

was discharged to Hendry Hospital where she had remained until May.

 

Her complaints today include some constipation, which she is relating 

to iron intake.  She is going to use some stool softeners and some milk 

of magnesia for this.  She also has some diaphoresis at nighttime, 

which she reports has occurred prior to her hospitalization.  

 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise, today she denies fever, chills, chest 

pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, 

or calf pain.

 

PHYSICAL EXAM: On physical exam she is healthy appearing in no apparent 

distress.  She is accompanied today by her daughter.  Her weight is 164 

pounds.  Her vital signs are 103/80, 70, 16, 96.6.  Her abdomen is 

soft, nontender and nondistended.  Her midline incision is well healed 

with no evidence of hernia.

 

IMPRESSION:  Ischemic cecum.

 

PLAN: Patient was seen today by Dr. Oscar G. Gregory and Quiana N. 

Bullock, NP.  We will send over to her primary care physician the 

operative, pathology, and discharge summaries.  Shari does not need to 

return to clinic unless further surgical issues arise.

RE:  Peter Joshi

MRN: 453-39-84-4

 

Dear Dr. Craft:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Clinic today.  This lovely gentleman continues to see

both me and Dr. Orlena Knowles.  I have discussed this with Dr.

Knowles and I am certainly comfortable in whatever role you all

would need to see me playing in Mr. Joshi's care.  He notes that

his weight has increased to 212 lb and that he has been followed

closely by Dr. Knowles who is adjusting Lasix and potassium

chloride doses.  He has had no shortness of breath at rest.  He

has noticed no significant change in his lower extremity edema. 

He has mild orthopnea and no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  His

medical regimen includes aspirin 325 mg PO q.d., Lasix 80 mg PO

b.i.d., Isordil 40 mg PO b.i.d., Zestril 40 mg PO b.i.d.,

Lopressor 100 mg PO b.i.d., simvastatin 20 mg PO q.d., Norvasc 5

mg PO b.i.d., Prevacid 20 mg PO q.d., and K-Dur 25 mEq q.d. in

addition to albuterol, Atrovent, and Serevent.

 

His physical exam is notable for a blood pressure of 150/70 right

and left arm seated.  After rest, this comes down to 135/70 right

and left arm seated.  His heart rate is 70 and regular. 

Respiratory rate is 10.  His room air saturation is 95%.  His

lungs are clear to auscultation, although breath sounds are

somewhat distant.  Cardiovascular exam is notable for

nondisplaced PMI and a soft systolic ejection murmur.  His

abdomen is soft and nontender.  Extremities are notable for edema

to his knees bilaterally.

 

RE:  Peter Joshi

MRN: 453-39-84-4            -2-              June 06, 2070 

 

Electrocardiogram is notable for sinus rhythm with an axis of -14

and normal intervals, no evidence of ischemia or infarction.  No

change from prior electrocardiograms.

 

In summary, Mr. Joshi is currently being treated for ongoing

congestive heart failure.  His pulmonary evaluation here was

notable for a combination of restrictive and obstructive

pulmonary dysfunction.  I would certainly concur with continued

diuresis with close attention to his potassium, BUN, and

creatinine.

 

If there are any questions or issues, please give me a call.

 

Sincerely,

 

 

Corrine James-Wagner, M.D.

JONES,URIEL   222-67-70-8                    VISIT DATE: 07/19/25

Seen with Dr. Person.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, REVIEW OF 

SYSTEMS, MEDICATIONS, ALLERGIES:  Were reviewed and confirmed.  

Please see Resident note for further details.  

HISTORY:  I interviewed and examined the patient myself.  The 

history briefly is as follows.  This is a 51 year-old male who was 

recently discharged from the hospital here after a successful 

percutaneous lithotripsy and nephrostomy placement.  He presented 

this evening for a leakage from his nephrostomy tube which he 

believes may have become dislodged or had its cap removed when he 

was sitting on the sofa and got up.  He has been leaking 

serosanguineous fluid since earlier today.  He has no fever, 

chills.  No other complaints.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes diabetes, hypertension, CAD, high 

cholesterol.  

MEDICATIONS:  He takes hydrochlorothiazide, Zestril, Calan, Zocor 

and Levaquin.   

ALLERGIES:  He has no allergies to medications.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise negative.  

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his family.  

FAMILY HISTORY:  He has no significant family history.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His temperature is 99.2, heart rate 93, 

blood pressure 136/81.  He is an awake and alert male in no acute 

distress.  HEENT - Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Oropharynx clear.  

Neck is supple.  Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.  

Cardiovascular exam is regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub 

or gallop.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  Mildly obese.  Skin is 

warm and dry.  Left flank is with some resolving ecchymosis.  No 

obvious subcutaneous fluid, and the area around the nephrostomy 

drain is intact.  His gurney linens are soaked with serosanguineous 

fluid.  Extremities without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  

Neurologically alert and oriented.  Cranial nerves II-XII are 

intact.  No motor or sensory deficits.   

CONSULTATIONS:  He is seen in consultation by the Urology Service 

and his tubing was cut back and cap replaced.  It is unclear as 

this was placed by Radiology exactly the exact 

configuration of the tubing.  However, it appears to have ceased 

leak at this time.  

DISPOSITION:  He is discharged in satisfactory condition with 

instructions to return for return of symptoms or for any other 

concerns, and to call to have follow up arranged for early next 

week.

The patient returns not having been seen since last September by
me and at which time she had some chest pain which did not turn
out to be anything significant.  She is followed up by Dr. Horne
who felt that she had a lot of anxiety and she was at that time
on lisinopril as well as her other diabetic medications.  She
comes back from Maine.  She is on the following medications:
1.  Lipitor 20 mg q.d.
2.  Glynase 1.5 mg b.i.d.
3.  Glucophage 500 mg b.i.d.
4.  Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d.
5.  Avandia 4 mg q.a.m.
6.  Trandate 100 mg q.d.
7.  Tegretol 300 mg in the a.m. 150 mg in the p.m.
8.  Neurontin 200 mg b.i.d. (she was told she could discontinue
this)
9.  Premarin and Provera discontinued.
10.  Aspirin 81 mg q.d.
12.  Calcium 1200 mg q.d.

She states today that her abdomen has been distended for the past
5 days.  She has not had a bowel movement in 10 days.  She
ordinarily has a bowel movement once every 2 weeks.  She takes
nothing to move her bowels and she is extraordinarily upset about
her daughter who is homeless.  She has provided for her daughter,
helped her get a job, and the daughter is emotionally ill, and I
have advised the patient that she should be in a mental
institution.  The patient no longer care for her daughter and her
daughter cares nothing about her father and mother.  It is a
hopeless situation and 45 minutes were spent in discussion of the
daughter's illness and what the patient would do about this.  I
have told her to use some Dulcolax suppositories and Dulcolax by
mouth for probable impacted feces, although this is not an
uncommon thing for her and I have ordered a set of blood tests to
check on her diabetes, kidney function, etc.  She has a good
physician in Maine where she is planning to move in June and
she will return to me next week for a complete physical.  She
does have diabetic neuropathy mild and diabetic nephropathy mild.
 Her back has healed.  She no longer uses a cane to walk except
on climbing stairs.  She no longer has any chest pain or
shortness of breath.  She is extraordinarily anxious and
hopefully she will listen to the advice that I gave her.  Total
time spent during this visit was 45 minutes.

CC: 
LLQ pain


HPI: 
Mr. Jay is a 48yo with type II DM c/b diabetic retinopathy, ESRD on HD, bilateral TMA, and HTN who presents with LLQ pain x2 days.
Mr. Jay was seen in the ED the day prior to admission with the same complaint of new onset LLQ pain, which was sharp, non radiating, and most painful with inspiration.  He reports that at this time, he has some mild shortness of breath with the onset of the pain, although this was resolved by the time he was seen in the ED.  He did not complain of any chest pain, palpitations or dipahoresis at that time, although he did have some nausea and vomited once in the ED.  Patient is well known to the ED from prior admissions, and at that time his pain was felt to be 2/2 to throacic radiculopathy/neuropathy 2/2 to his diabetes, however acuity of pain, CT abdomen was performed at that time, which did not reveal any acute patholgy to explain his pain.  He was discharged to home at that time with oral pain medication.  Patient reports that pain did not improve, and was not well controlled with oral pain mediations at home, so he re- presented to the ED.  He does not report any fevers or chills, shortness of breath, cough, back pain, or LE swelling.  Patient is anuric and has been attending dialysis per his usual MWF routine.  


On presentation to the ED, patient was afebrile, BP 180s/90s, HR 70s, satting 100% on RA.  He was given IV morphine for his pain, and IV benedryl for nausea (he has had a cyclic vomiting/nausea syndrome on prior admission which has been effectively treated this way).  Patient reported at that time that he had not had a bowel movement in 3 days, and that he normally has one every other day.  Rectal exam did not reveal any stool in the vault, and CT scan from the day prior did not show excessive stool or evidence of obstruction or fecal impaction.  However, patient was given dulcolax PR.  He was admitted to medicine for further evaluation and pain control.

VINCENT,ROBERTA J.   380-18-32-2                    VISIT DATE: 03/31/98
See primarily by Dr. Ulises Collier.  I also saw the patient and 
reviewed Dr. Collier's history. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 62 year-old woman comes from 
dial where she developed substernal chest pain radiating to her 
left arm near the end of the run.  She also complains of shortness 
of breath.  She noted some nausea, but no vomiting.  She had no 
other related symptoms.  She has had no previous history of chest 
pain.  She was given Nitroglycerin x 3 and this eventually relieved 
her pain. 
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes end-stage renal disease, 
coronary artery disease with a bypass graft but without any chest 
pain at the time, and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus which may 
account for her previous cardiac history without chest pain. 
ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN AND CODEINE 
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin and Xanax. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 164/94, pulse 
94, respirations 24, oxygen saturation 96%.  GENERAL:  The patient 
is comfortable in no acute distress.  HEAD AND NECK: 
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal and reactive. Pharynx 
benign.  Tongue is of normal shape and contour.  Neck is supple. 
No jugular venous distention.  LUNGS:  Are clear bilaterally. 
CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm.  S1, S2, with no murmurs, rubs 
or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and non-tender with normal bowel 
sounds.  EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema or rash. 
NEUROLOGICAL:  Patient is alert and oriented x 3.  She moves all 
extremities.  Has symmetrical strength and all proximal and distal 
upper and lower motor bilaterally.  Normal sensation to light touch 
grossly. 
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 9, hematocrit 41.  Glucose was 
high at 533.  However, she has bicarbonate of 24, so she is 
probably not in diabetic ketoacidosis.  BUN 31, creatinine 3.8. 
Troponin-I was 0.5.  Chest x-ray was negative.  Electrocardiogram 
shows normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and 
non-specific ST/T wave changes.  Perhaps some ST depressions in II, 
III and AVF, and deep S waves in V1, 2, 3, and 4. 
TREATMENT RENDERED AND COURSE IN ED: In the hospital the patient 
did not have further chest pain here.  She was admitted for chest 
pain and for rule out myocardial infarction to the Medical Service. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Rule out myocardial infarction 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Admitted.

EDVISIT^91464150^Godwin, Yair^04/24/76^MURRAY, MARION OSCAR

The patient was interviewed and examined primarily by me.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right chest wall pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old male

who presents to Bowne Hospital Emergency Department with no

one-week history of right-sided lateral chest wall pain.  The

patient states the pain is worse with movement including

stretching, bending, and reaching.  The patient states that

patient had slept with a hot water bottle on his right chest wall

for pain relief and had pain relief and was sitting in a chair. 

His lying down on his right side was painful, and this morning,

sat up and while getting up, exacerbated the chest wall pain. 

The patient discussed this pain with his primary care physician

during the past 2 weeks and who had been in agreement that it is

probable muscle strain.  The patient denies any headache, visual

changes, and dizziness.  Denies any neck pain.  Denies any

left-sided chest pain.  Denies any nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis,

or dyspnea.  Denies any abdominal pain.  He has been afebrile. 

No cough.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes hypertension and non-insulin

dependent diabetes.  The patient also has exposure to asbestos

and asbestos changes on CT scan previously.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past tobacco, past ETOH, no IV drug abuse, lives

with his family, and he is retired.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As indicated in the history of present

illness, otherwise negative.

MEDICATIONS:  See nursing note for full list of medications.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known allergies to medications.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert in no acute

distress.  Temperature 95.4, pulse of 67, respiratory rate of 16,

blood pressure 179/78, and O2 saturation 95% on room air.  HEENT

is atraumatic.  ENT:  No infection.  Pharynx is normal.  Neck is

supple and nontender.  Respiratory exam:  Chest wall is tender. 

Patient has reproducible, palpable right-sided posterior lateral

and anterior lateral chest wall tenderness.  Normal breath sounds

bilaterally, no rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac exam: 

Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, and normal pulses throughout.

 Abdomen is soft.  The patient has some minimal amount of right

upper quadrant tenderness just subcostal at the infracostal

margin.  No rebound or guarding.  Skin is warm, dry, and intact,

no lesions, or rashes.  Extremities are nontender. Normal range

of motion.  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neurologic exam: 

Cranial nerves II through XII intact bilaterally.  No motor or

sensory deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  Significant for white count of 10.6, hematocrit

of 38.5, platelets of 244,000.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.1,

chloride of 105, bicarbonate 23, BUN 38, creatinine 1.9, and

glucose of 165.  ALT of 11, AST of 16, amylase of 71, and lipase

61.

Given the fact that the patient had some right upper quadrant

pain and pain was radiating laterally to the right anterior

aspect, patient received a right upper quadrant ultrasound, which

History of Present Illness

Asked by Dr. Ehlers to consult on glycemic management for Mr. Ulysses Ehlers who has no history of DM but was noted to be hyperglycemic postop. Mr. Ehlers is POD 1, s/p C4. His family history is positive for diabetes (mother diagnosed in her 80s).  He has required a regular insulin gtt protocol intermittently postop. He is now on a full liquid diet.



Max BG: 197

Current BG: 145

Insulin gtt off at present

 

Mr. Ehlers is a 69 yo M h/o CAD s/p MI 2084 (posterolateral), HTN, hyperlipidemia, a-fib, AAA, PVD, smoking (50 pk yr) who presents for CABG. Initially presented to Bonner General Hospital 9/97 for w/u of exertional chest pain. Cardiac cath was unsuccessful via femoral approach due to presumed aortoiliac occlusion. Subsequent cath 10/18/97 revealed left main stenosis with distal occlusion, RCA proximal occlusion and diffuse LAD stenosis.

LOUISIANA AVENUE MEDICAL CENTER


Patient:  Ehlers, Ulysses	MR: 28735364
Renal Attending: Dr. Judge
Admission Date: 4/24/2098			Consultation Date: 4/24/2098

Reason for Consultation: 
Progressive renal impairment.
Creat rose from 1.6 (Nov 97) to 4.07 (may 98)

History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 year old male with a hx of CAD s/p CABG 10/2097, who was referred on 6/03 from renal Dr. Turk, Elvis at the Central Buffalo Hospital to Dr. Judge at BHCC for rapidly progressive renal impairment.  He is an arteriopath with occluded aorta beneath the levels of renal arteries as revealed in recent MRA. In the past an attempted femoral artery cannulation was proved unsuccessful due to above reason. Subsequently he underwent two cardiac angiograms thro' left brachial and Rt radial arterial route.

 His creatinine has risen from baseline of 1.6 (Nov 97, post CABG) to 4.07 (may 98). He denies taking any NSAIDS. He thinks that he was started on Altace post surgery, but was not sure about that fact.

Dr. Turk did an duplex scan to assess his renal arteries which was suggestive of high grade stenosis of renal arteries on both sides. Since IR doctors at CentralBuffalo were not keen to do renal agniogram/angioplasty thro' radial artery route, Dr.Turk refered Mr. Ehlers to BHCC for consideration of renal angioplasty. He has also asked him to discontinue Altace and to withold coumadin (Indn: AF) inview of potential angioplasty.

He complains of claudication pains in both legs with left leg>Rt leg. He experiences pain on exertion on left calf, thigh and buttock. He complains of long term pedal swelling which extends upto upper knee level. He is SOB on moderate exertion and sleeps with 3 pillows. He also has some prostatic symptoms with poor urinary stream, frequency etc.

ASSESSMENT:
Progressive renal dysfunction in the setting of severe bilateral renal artery stenosis for consideration of reno-vascular disease.

PLAN:
1. His MRA of abdomen was reviewed with Dr.Quilici, BHCC IR department. Aorta is fully occluded beneath the level of both kidneys. Tight renal artery stenosis noted in both kidneys. Both proximal and distal stenosis noted in the Rt renal artery. Both kidneys appeared normal in size 11.2 and 11.4 cm. Dr.Quilici is confident that renal angioplasty could be done relatively safely through radial artery approach.

2. We have requested Dr.Xi, Vascular surgeon to get his opinon on the need for surgical revascularisation of feet to save his legs from critical ischemia in the future. If so, whether he would benefit from surgical revascularisation of the kidneys. We are awaiting his expert opinion.

3. Patient realises that renal angiogram + angioplasty thro' radial artery carries its own risk. Risks of Cholesterol emboli, Contrast nephropathy, arterial injury, risk of further deterioration of his kidney function leading to early initiation of dialysis are explained. However patient feels that it worth taking a choice to prevent the kidneys from worsening rapidly by attempted angiopalsty.

4. We will obtain renal ultrasound to again measure his kidneys and to rule out any obstructive uropathy as the cause of renal dysfunction.

5. If patient is going for IR renal angiogram/plasty, then he will need Contrast prophylaxis.

We will review him tomorrow with Dr.Xi's opinon.

Renal Staff

I have seen and examined the patient twice today, and have reviewed his MR studies with radiology
In essence I agree with Dr Youngman's recs.

Patient has normal sized kidneys with insidious rise in Cr without obvious identifiable remediable causes.
He has severe aortic disease with occlusion of the aortia, mod severe bilateral claudication in LL.
His renal arteries have ostial stenoses bilaterally.

His options are:
1) conservative approach, and likely ESRD in the coming weeks
2) Radiological placements of bilateral stents via L brachial artery
3) Surgical bypass as a part of larger repair for LL claudication

We are in discussions with Radiology and Surgery to come up with a final recommendation which we will d/w patient tomorrow.

CXR:

FINDINGS:

	No infiltrates or evidence of CHF is present.  There is a three cm

	mass in the right lower lung.  This was shown to be rounded

	atelectasis on chest CT.  Pleural changes are consistent with

	asbestos related pleural disease.

	



IMPRESSION:

	FINDINGS:

	No comparison.  The aorta is of normal caliber.  There is

	atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta.  Classic arch anatomy

	is present.

	Bilateral pleural calcific plaques are demonstrated consistent

	with asbestos related pleural disease.  In addition, in the

	posterior segment right lower lobe there is 2.7 cm mass.  The mass

	has a linear pleural attachment adjacent to pleural plaques.

	There is also present swirling vessels around the mass and volume

	loss.  The findings are consistent with rounded atelectasis.  A

	smaller focus of rounded atelectasis is present in the left lower

	lobe.

	Coronary artery calcifications present.  No mediastinal or hilar

	or axillary lymphadenopathy is present.  There is no

	supraclavicular adenopathy.

	The osseous structures are unremarkable.

	Please see dictated abdomen report.

	



IMPRESSION:

	1.  Normal caliber aorta please see MRA report regarding

	evaluation of dissection.

	2.  Bilateral rounded atelectasis and asbestos related pleural

	disease.

	

	



   WMC  MRA AORTA + &  01-Aug-2076 09:10 





REPORT:

	This study was reviewed with Dr. Upshur.

	MRA OF THE THORAX WAS WITH AND WITHOUT GADOLINIUM.

	Technique: Standard departmental MRA protocol of the chest and

	upper abdomen was performed with and without gadolinium. 3-D

	images were obtained and interpreted.

	Findings:

	There is a three vessel aortic arch.  There is no evidence of a

	flap within the aorta to suggest a dissection. The takeoffs of the

	great vessels are normally patent. There is no evidence of

	aneurysm.

	The celiac artery and SMA are patent. There are single renal

	arteries bilaterally.  There is mild narrowing of the proximal

	right renal artery.  The left renal artery is patent.

	



IMPRESSION:

	Unremarkable MRA of the thoracic aorta, without evidence of

	dissection or aneurysm.

	Mild narrowing of the proximal right renal artery.

	FOLSOM CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL

	



	Interval History:

   Mr.  Lilly is now 81 years old and it has been six and half years since his coronary bypass procedure.  Since I saw him last six months ago, he has generally done well.  He has not had any angina.  No dyspnea, orthopnea, lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations, or syncope.  He has reduced his exercise to three days a week-he exercises vigorously when he does exercise, but this seems to give him a little bit more in the way of stamina.



	Past medical history:

   Noncontributory.



Current Medications:

  Nexium 40 mg BID

 Ecotrin 325 mg qd

 Toprol XL 50 mg qd

 Effexor 75 mg qam; Dir: and 37.5 mg qpm

 metformin hydrochloride 850 mg BID

 Zocor 40 mg; Dir: 4 days a week and 80 mg 3 days a week

 ranitidine HCl 300 mg qhs

 flaxseed oil; Dir: Gel

 vitamin b12 1 mg qd

 vitamin c

 Omega 1 tab tid; Dir: 3 fatty acids



	Family history:

   Noncontributory.



	Social history:

   He has four children and 10 grandchildren.  He just returned to Tunisia to visit family.  He does not smoke.  Minimal alcohol.  His wife recently had quite a bad fall.



	Review of systems:

   Weight is stable.  No GI problems.  Otherwise negative.



Physical examination:

	

-Pulse:   60

-BP: 145/70    140-145/70

-resp. rate:   16

-General:   He looks great

-Neck:   The jugular venous pressure was less than 5.  No carotid bruits.  No palpable lymph nodes

-Chest:   The lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation

-Cardiac:   Showed an S4.  Normal S1.  No murmurs

-Abdomen:   Liver and spleen are not enlarged

-Extremities:   Good femoral, popliteal, and pedal pulses



	EKG:

    shows first-degree AV bock and minor ST and T changes.  No change from July 2075.



	Assessment and plan:

   Mr.  Lilly is generally doing well.  His blood pressure is a little higher than it usually is in the office today, and we probably should have him on ACE inhibitor with his mild diabetes.  On the other hand, he is a little worked up over his wife's injury, and we will monitor his pressure.  For now, we will sit tight.  He will have a full battery of chemistries tomorrow-he sees Dr.  Mccullough, so far so good with respect to his cardiac sinus.  



Plan: Monitor blood pressure.  Low threshold for starting an ACE inhibitor.  Chemistries tomorrow.  See again in six months.

MOUNTAIN SIDE INTERN ACCEPT NOTE

Patient:  Isenberg, Michael
MRN:  3674193
Date of Admission:  25-March-2064
PCP:  Dr. Charles Uher (DSH)
Attending:  Julian Quintela/Micheal Leyva
 
CC:  Chest pain

HPI:For full details, please see SDU Admission Note of 3/22/64 and SDU transfer note of 3/25/64.  In brief, the patient is a 81 y/o man with CRI, Type II DM and hypertension who was in his USOH until Thursday evening, when he developed substernal chest pain around 7pm, associated with dyspnea, but no  radiation diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting.  The pain lasted approximately 15-20 minutes.  EMS was called, who brought him to the HCC ED, where he was found to be tachypneic, with an O2 of 85%.  His pain was alleviated with IV NTG, and BiPap improved his O2 saturation.  He was found to have an interventricular conduction delay and a positive troponin.  He was begun on aspirin, lopressor, lasix, heparin, and integrelin and sent to the cath lab, where he was found to have 3-vessel disease not amenable to percutaneous interventions.  He was sent to the SDU, where he was started on lasix 60IV BID and a CABG pre-op workup was begun.  Since admission to the SDU, he has been stable, with excellent RA sats.  His Troponin-T peaked at 2.91 and was slow to return to normal, 2.65 on last draw today. He was diuresed aggressively and transferred to the floor with no oxygen requirement, having no chest pain.
	On the floor, he was stable but had a 15-beat self-limited run of MMVT, his BP was 110/60 and he was asymptomatic, with no chest pain or dyspnea.  He was given 4 gm iv of MgSO4, 60 mEq of KCL.  Repeat cardiac enzymes drawn at the time were significant for a troponin-T of 3.73 but with a CK of 133 (303) and CK-MB of 5.2 (16.2).  

Past Medical History:

RE:  Rivers, Ida 
MRN: 71701456 
DOV: 06/19/64

Dear Dr. Ito,

Ida was seen back today for evaluation of Sjogren's as well as left wrist 
pain.  Her Sjogren's has been reasonably stable.  She still remains with 
difficulty in controlling her blood sugar.  She has continued difficulty with 
her oral cavity.  She has had no extraglandular symptoms -- specifically, 
polyneuropathy, myopathy, or purpura.

She uses artificial tears and saliva.  She remains on insulin and estrogens.

She has a one-week history of pain and swelling of her left wrist.  She was 
seen at the Graduate Hospital Emergency Room several days ago.  Radiographs of the 
wrist show chondrocalcinosis.  She was started on Motrin with some response 
but still has active symptoms.  She is wearing a splint.

Today on exam, she is afebrile.  There was OA involving the DIP joints.  PIPs 
and MCPs were nontender.  The left wrist showed swelling and heat with 
diminished motion.  Right wrist showed full range of motion.  Elbows, 
shoulders, hips, knees, ankles, and feet did not show active synovitis.  
There was no adenopathy and lungs were clear.

I aspirated the left wrist under sterile technique.  No fluid was obtained.  
I injected it with 40 mg of Depo-Medrol.

Clinically, I think she has had pseudogout.  She has chondrocalcinosis on 
radiograph and has a clinical picture consistent with crystal disease.  In 
addition, she has primary Sjogren's.  The two diseases are unrelated.

In addition to injection of her wrist, I switched her from Motrin to Celebrex 
200 mg twice a day due to side effect profile issues.  She should probably 
take that for about five to seven days.  Side effects were reviewed.

I would like to see her back in four months.  She will be returning to you 
for further care in the interim.

VINCENT,ROBERTA J.   380-18-32-2                    VISIT DATE: 05/27/96
PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 59 year old female who 
presents to us with shortness of breath tonight.  She has been 
developing shortness of breath now with nausea and vomiting today. 
There is no history of fevers, no chills, and no abdominal pain. 
She does complain of some mild flank pain but nothing significant. 
She has had chronic back pain for years. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a significant past medical 
history.  History is significant for hypertension, diabetes, and 
congestive heart failure.  She is status post total abdominal 
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and status post 
L5-S1 laminectomy. 
MEDICATIONS:  The patient is on multiple medications including 
Lasix, lisinopril, prednisone, Premarin, nifedipine. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Here the patient looked mildly 
uncomfortable.  Blood pressure was 151/58, oxygen saturation was 99 
percent, and heart rate was 98.  Blood pressure has remained stable 
since she has been here.  Heent examination was normal.  Pupils 
were reactive normally bilaterally.  Oropharynx was clear.  Neck 
was mildly obese with no jugular venous distention.  There were 
good carotid upstrokes, no bruit.  Lungs had some crackles 
two-thirds of the way up and some rales at the bases, one-half way 
up.  Cardiac examination revealed S1 and S2, somewhat tachycardic, 
with a 2/6 murmur.  Abdomen had multiple striae and was soft and 
non-tender, with good bowel sounds.  There were good pulses 
throughout.  Extremities were normal. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Electrolytes here were normal.  Blood sugar 
was normal.  White count was 14, hematocrit 34.  Initial CK was 
140, troponin 2.6.  Chest x-ray showed moderate effusion and a 
small left effusion.  Patient's last echocardiogram showed an 
ejection fraction of 60 percent.  This echocardiogram was done in 
February of 2096.  She also had a second echocardiogram in April of 
2096 which showed an ejection fraction of 55 percent, with moderate 
MR.  EKG here showed ST depression in V6 and some decreased T's in 
aVR and aVL.  Sinus rhythm on EKG rated about 100. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  In the Emergency Department the 
patient was heparinized.  She was placed on oxygen, given an 
aspirin, and placed on a Nitroglycerin drip.  She also received 
some Nitropaste here.  She also received a mg of Morphine.  SFOC 
Cardiology was aware of the patient's troponin of 2.6, indicating 
that she had a myocardial infarction or could still be evolving a 
myocardial infarction here.  She received IV Lasix 60 mg here and 
responded very well.  She was diuresing considerably and her 
shortness of breath appeared to be much better than when she 
arrived here in the Emergency Department. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure with myocardial 
infarction, diuresing well and responding to medications. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 
admitted to the CCU.  SFOC is aware.  She remains in stable 
condition here and is going to be transferred up to CCU in a little 
while.  Condition at this time is satisfactory.

Vascular Surgery Admission Note



Patient Name:  Jain, Oliver

MRN:  9628518 

Date and Time: 8/25/33 2:40PM

Attending: Dr. Uselton

Fellow: Dr. Joshi

Resident: Dr. Ray-Gallegos

Night Float: Dr. Xayachack

PA: Brandi Xayasane, PA-C



cc: RLE graft stenosis



HPI: Mr. Jain is a 67 year old male with a h/o DM, HTN, HL, Chronic Afib, PVD and bilateral popliteal aneurysm s/p R popliteal thrombosis w/ resultant RLE ischemia and dry gangrene of heel, toes and forefoot.  He has since undergone a R SFA to BK popliteal bpg w/ saphenous vein graft and 8mm PTFE w/ angioplasty to the R PTA.  In March of this year he underwent a distal bpg from the R posterior tibial artery to the plantar artery and then a R TMA later that month. His R TMA has healed well since then. He is also s/p L fem-pop bpg to repair his L popliteal aneurysm.  



He saw Dr. Uselton in follow up last week at which time graft surveillance duplex showed normal functioning graft on the left, however on the right he appears to have a high-grade stenosis at the distal aspect of the femoral popliteal graft.  The more distal graft on the right, which is the vein graft to the plantar artery in the foot remains patent.  



He denies recent h/o fevers/chills, N/V, abdominal pain, or neurological sx. He c/o some RLE edema for the past 3 weeks. His PCP put him on a water pill but it had no effect.



He continues on coumadin for graft patentcy. His last dose was Saturday.

HISTORY


Diabetes: Yes



REASON FOR STUDY


Surveillance



Graft:-

Summary:   Left superficial femoral - popliteal (below knee) Bypass

Op. Date:  11/17/2132

Surgeon:   



Results:-

          Velocity  Ratio  Stenosis

          --------  -----  --------   

Inflow:    102.0

Proximal:  103.0      1.0  Normal

Mid-graft:  41.0      0.8  Normal

Distal:    133.0      6.0  Severe

Outflow:    57.0      0.4  Normal



ABI:      




SYMPTOMS



FINDINGS


The inflow (the left  mid superficial femoral artery)  is patent.  The 


proximal anastomosis is widely patent.  The proximal, mid- and distal graft is

  widely patent.  The distal anastomosis terminates in the popliteal artery 


(below the knee)  and demonstrates a significant increase in peak systolic 


velocity, correlating with 50-99% stenosis.  The distal native ( posterior 


tibial artery)  is patent.



IMPRESSION


1. Patent the left mid superficial femoral to popliteal artery (below the 


knee) BPG with &gt;50 % stenosis in the distal anastomosis


2. The mid- distal graft velocities of 41.0  - 22 cm/sec  suggest a 


compromised graft.





CXR-lungs clear, heart size upper limit of normal.





A/P:  67M w/ a h/o HTN, HL, DM, PVD and bilateral popliteal aneursyms s/p L fem-pop bpg; R popliteal thrombosis and subsequent R fem-pop bpg, R PT to plantar bpg and R TMA; presents with stenosis of the distal anastamosis of his femoral popliteal graft on the Right. He will undergo angiogram with possible angioplasty of graft stenosis.

Attending: Andersen
HPI: 


The patient is a 79yF with ESRD on HD. She is being dialyzed via a right brachiocephalic fistula that was created in Nov 2075. The patient is a very poor historian and the subsequent information has been collected from the medical record. While the fistula is beng used successfully for dialysis, it has undergone aneurysmal dilatation and the patient has also developed non-healing areas over the fistula at points of access. There is note made in the chart that the patient has had difficulty with recurrent outflow stenosis and for this she seems to have undergone angioplasty at Brooks Hospital (no record in LMR) recently. The patient does not have any complaints.

Rheumatology Visit
CANTU, VERNA L                        
MRN:  0261948

Date of Visit:  01/26/2098



Background:

Ms. Cantu is a 61-year-old diabetic woman with long-standing hypertension and peripheral vascular disease. She is followed in rheumatology for mixed connective tissue disease. She was initially seen in March 2094, when she was admitted with fever, nausea and chest pain. Her chest CT showed an interstitial pattern and a patulous esophagus; the interstitial lung disease was thought to be in part due to the mixed connective tissue disease and in part due to aspiration. She was also noted at that time to have an ANA 1:2560 speckled with positive RNP, negative Scl-70. Clinically, she had Sjogren's with sclerodermatous changes to her hands and telangiectasias across her face. The Raynaud's was exacerbated by the extensive peripheral vascular disease and she had to undergo stenting of the right common femoral artery 11/2095. Slowly these lesions healed. 


Interim Issues:
The diabetes and hypertension slowly became well controlled. But on exercise tolerance test, she presented with significant coronary artery disease and was noted to have significant aortic stenosis. In April 2097 she underwent stenting and she had a prosthetic aortic valve placed. Recovering from surgery has been slow. But it has been steady and uncomplicated. She can now go up 2 flights of stairs, then rest to go the third flight to her home. She has had no recurrent chest pain. She keeps her hands and feet warm and has had no tissue damage. She feels a little tightness in the chest wall in taking a deep breath (points anteriorly), but no dyspnea per se. She healed well postoperatively. She has recently been seen by cardiology and Dr. Nichols and seems to be in good shape. Her medications were reviewed and updated in the LMR. 



In terms of the MCTD, she continues to have some Raynaud's. She tries to keep her hands warm and she has had little breakdown of the tissue but rather thickening of her hands. What troubles her most is the intermittent synovitis. She felt much better on 5 mg of prednisone daily. She remains on Plaquenil 200 mg daily. She has had no worsening swallowing.  She has had no fever, pneumonia or progressive dyspnea on exertion. She sleeps on two pillows. She denies waking up with any bitterness in her mouth. She continues on omeprazole. Complete ROS in detail is otherwise negative. 


MEDS:
Amlodipine 5 MG QD 
Aspirin  325 MG QD  
Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 MG QD 
Lisinopril 2.5 MG QD 
Metformin 500 MG BID 
Metoprolol Succinate Extended Release 25 MG QD 
Plaquenil  200 MG  QD 
Simvastatin 20 MG  QHS



FH/SH: She comes in with her husband, who feels she is doing very well and is delighted to see her better. Ms. Cantu went back to work 3 months after surgery.

She has telangiectasias over her face. She looks well to me. Her color is good and she smiles easily. She has profound dryness of her mouth, but no particular injection of her eyes. Her neck is reasonably supple, the skin tightened here. Perhaps tightened a bit over her face as well. But the chest wall itself has no scleroderma. The midline scar has healed beautifully. The respiratory excursions appear full. There is no splinting. There are some bilateral crackles. Her hands are thickened from the scleroderma aspect of her disease. There are no nail bed infarcts. There is some peripheral pitting of digits. Her feet are well healed, warm and well perfused. Her joints are benign today with no active synovitis. Heart: S1, S2 with a soft crisp, S2 noted. No insufficiency murmurs. 



IMPRESSION: 

MCTD/Raynaud's.
Sjogren's

ASCVD with aortic valve replacement 4/2097. 

PVD. 


PLAN

Education regarding the importance of protection re: trauma to finger tips and prevention of Raynaud's. 
Continue Prilosec, refill Plaquenil
Prescribe prednisone 5 mg p.r.n. arthritis. I think it would be safe for her to take every morning as long as her diabetes remains well controlled and she feels much better on it; that is, the benefits outweigh the risks. 


Her labs have been sent and a chest x-ray obtained. 


I will see her in 6 months, sooner if there are any issues in the interim. 
Interview time 45 minutes due to medical history review, questions and verification of medications with the patient. 


She and her husband agree with this plan.

Otto Qazi
MR# 527-62-21
Date of Admission: January 12, 2083
Admitting JAR: Hunter Hayden, MD
Attending:  Quinten Prado, MD

Reason for Transfer: STEMI

HPI:   
58yoM with h/o CAD, HTN, smoking; presents to FHO with chest pain and found to have lateral STEMI.  He experienced mild central chest pain on the night prior to admission while working outdoors, pain resolved after about an hour and he attributed it to GERD.  However, he awoke at 5:30 AM on the morning of presentation with recurrence of chest pain, 6/10 severity, lasted for about 15-30 minutes and then resolved with Maalox.  Pain recurred about 9:30, of similar severity, associated with dyspnea, diaphoresis, non radiating, non-pleuritic.  He again took zantac and Maalox without improvement.  After 15 minutes he walked to the local hospital ER and during walk the pain increased in severity to 8/10.  He describes the pain as similar to his previous MI.

Upon arrival to FHO found to have ST elevations antero-lateral.  Given lopressor, heparin, integrillin, morphine, ASA, and medivac to WCH arranged for cath.  He states that by the time he was in transit, his chest pain had resolved.  He arrived at WCH, was taken directly to cath lab, found to have a proximal LAD lesion with cypher stent placed.  He remained chest pain free following the procedure and was sent to the CCU in stable condition.

At baseline he states he can walk    a couple    of miles without rest, he rarely takes stairs on a daily basis.  He smokes profusely and has little interest in quitting.  He feels he has had no occurrence of chest pain since last one.  However, he does report that his plavix was stopped recently, and he has difficulty affording all his medications.

RUTLEDGE,XAVIER W.   539-54-14-3               VISIT DATE: 04/28/65
This patient was seen with Dr. Russell, medicine resident.  The 
chief complaint, history of presenting illness, past medical 
history, medications, allergies, social history, family history and 
review of systems are as noted by Dr. Russell on the record, and 
were reviewed with her and with the patient. 
PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Chills, temperature to 104 degrees. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Briefly, this is a 56 year old 
man status post renal transplant, who was recently admitted to a 
hospital for rising creatinine.  Tests showed that he had 
cyclosporine toxicity of his graft and cyclosporine was reduced. 
He was discharged home yesterday.  This was confirmed by biopsy. 
He was fine overnight, but then had some chills this morning, and 
presented to the Emergency Department with a temperature of 104 
degrees. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Is as noted by Dr. Russell on the record 
and basically does not identify a source of infection.  The chest 
is clear to auscultation.  The abdomen is soft with the exception 
of some tenderness over his graft site.  The wound site was 
apparently inspected by the admitting team and was not found to 
show any evidence of infection. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Laboratory studies are still pending. 
Cultures were obtained of both blood and urine. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Fevers, status post renal transplant. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Disposition - 
admission.  Condition satisfactory.  The primary physician, Dr. 
Oviedo, was notified.

EDVISIT^22267708^JONES, URIEL^05/30/31^COOKE, FREDI

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 67 year-old male was seen in

transfer from Friends Hospital for evaluation of progressively

worsening shortness of breath over the last 2 days, associated

with increased fatigue and episodes of chest pressure yesterday. 

He did note increase weight for the last 1-2 months,

progressively worsening shortness of breath with minimal

exertion.  He did have chest pressure at rest yesterday, which

did radiate to his left shoulder.  This seemed to resolve

spontaneously and then he noted shortness of breath with any kind

of exertion at all.  The shortness of breath was exclusively

exertional.  He has not noticed nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis,

presyncopal symptoms or diarrhea.  No fevers.  He does have a

slight cough that is nonproductive.  He was seen at a local

Emergency Department today where he had laboratory studies as

well as was given Lasix, albuterol, and nitroglycerin and states

he has some relief of his symptoms associated with this.  He was

cardioverted 2 days ago for atrial fibrillation by his

cardiologist at SAH.  Additionally, at the outside Emergency

Department, his INR was therapeutic at 2 as he is on Coumadin,

but his troponin was elevated at 0.16.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, orally

controlled diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and atrial flutter. 

He has had a cardiac catheterization last in 2127.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a past smoker with 10 pack years of

smoking.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the written chart and HPI,

otherwise negative.

MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin, citalopram, metoprolol, lisinopril,

glipizide, Cipro, and simvastatin.

ALLERGIES:  He is allergic to penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99, pulse 63, respiratory rate

20, blood pressure 140/86, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air.

 HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pleasant, calm.  Neck is

supple.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation, except for

scattered rales in the left lower lung field.  Cardiovascular: 

Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Abdomen is soft and

nontender.  Skin is intact, warm, and dry.  Extremities:  He has

got 1+ edema of the bilateral lower extremities that is

symmetric.  Neuropsych:  He is oriented x3, moves all extremities

equally.

LABORATORY DATA:  ECG shows a sinus rhythm at 65 with poor R-wave

progression, but no acute ST segment abnormalities.  Chest x-ray

shows interstitial increased markings with a small left pleural

effusion and prominence of the ventricle consistent with mild

pulmonary edema.  Cardiac biomarkers show troponin of 0.16 with

creatinine of 1.43, CK-MB of 3.2 with normal index, and CK of 87.

 BNP is still pending.  INR is 2.5, which is therapeutic on

Coumadin.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  At the outside Emergency

Department, he did receive Lasix and he put off approximately 2

liters of urine since then with significant symptomatic

improvement in his dyspnea.  He has no further episodes of chest

pain or pressure.  I did discuss the case with Dr. Davison,

the SAH cardiologist on-call.  I believe this patient has CHF

exacerbation.  He also was recently cardioverted, which ____

explain his troponin elevation.  Additionally, his CHF

exacerbation alone could explain his troponin elevation, and I

doubt the patient has an acute coronary syndrome.  At this point,

the patient is already anticoagulated by virtue of being on

Coumadin.  We will hold any further heparinization or Lovenox at

this time.  However, he will have serial cardiac biomarkers, will

be admitted to the Cardiology Service for evaluation and for

further evaluation and optimization of his congestive heart

failure and for monitoring of his troponin levels.

DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure exacerbation, troponin

elevation, and diabetes.

DISPOSITION:  Admission in stable condition.

Re:  Peter Joshi

MR #45339844

 

Dear Dr. Hodges:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Hospital Regional Universitario.  This lovely gentleman with ischemic heart disease and 

congestive heart

failure has been followed in our clinic since the time of his carotid 

endarterectomy and cardiac

procedure.  At the present time, he notes that he has been very minimally 

active because of the

flooding.  He has had no paroxysms of chest discomfort.  He has had no exertional 

neck, chest, arm

or jaw pain.  He has had dyspnea on exertion at greater than 4 METS of 

activity and he does

have mild lower extremity edema.

 

His medical regimen includes aspirin, Demadex, isosorbide, Lopressor, 

simvastatin, Norvasc,

Prevacid, multivitamins, potassium chloride and insulin.  

 

On physical examination, his weight is 223 pounds.  His blood pressure is 

124/60 right and left

arm seated.  His heart rate is 54 and regular.  Respiratory rate is 10.  

There is a mild increase in

jugular venous pressure.  Carotids are without bruits.  Lungs are actually 

clear to auscultation

throughout.  Cardiovascular exam is notable for a systolic ejection murmur 

but no gallop is

present.  His abdomen is soft, nontender, free of organomegaly and bruits.  

Extremities are

notable for symmetric pulses somewhat diminished at the level of the 

posterior tibialis and mild

pitting edema to the midshin bilaterally.  

 

His electrocardiogram is sinus bradycardia with inverted T waves in I and L.  

No significant

change from prior electrocardiograms.

 

In summary, Patrick Joshi looks like he is in mild volume overload at the 

present time.  He reports

that he has had renal insufficiency in the past.  Before adjusting his 

Demadex dosing, I will

reassess his kidney profile.

gentleman, please feel free

to give me a call.

Main issue is whether his hematologic abnormalities are secondary to infection, presumably immiune-mediated, or whether there is primary hematologic disorder with worrisome WBC/diff. Has clinical bleeding as well as thrombocytopenia.  Lung abnormality may be pneumonia, but given context needs further definition--unlikely bacterial. 



I've asked Dr. Flora Cole to consult.

HPI

51 yo F with MMP comes to establish primary care as she is unhappy with the cre she is geting at CityMemorial. She was 40 mislate to her appt and time was limited. She has multiple medical problems for which she is on a variety of medications, none o which she has taken x1 month as she ran out of refills.



1. CVA-She reports 3-4 mos ago she had a stroke (she was told there was a clot in her brain) which left the L side of her face paralyzed and some residual weakness in her LUE. She also notes her handwriting has completely changed since. Since the stroke she has had multiple episodes during which her tongue becomes very heavy and she has difficulty speaking (distinctly different from her now mildly imapired baseline) At these times she feel somewhat confused and her L vison seems blurry. This has happened 4-5 times and lasts all day. er family has encouraged her to seek medical care but she has refused bc she did not think they would do antyhing for her. Of note, pt has not been on ASA as it was d/cd when she changed to celebrex. Pt also c/o memory loss that started even before the CVA.



2. CAD-She reports a h/o multiple MIs, incl cardiac cath x2, unknown if she had intevention, she thinks the last was about 1 yr ago. She has stable 3 pillow orthopnea. She becomes SOB when she climbs 5 steps and gets SOB sometimes when she walks, which resolves ith rest, but she is able to walk a fair amt still (cannot pin down how much).  She denies CP with exertion, did have CP with her MIs. She says smx she has lower and upper extremity edema. She has not had a recent ETT.



3. DM-Pt has been on glucophage and Humulin 70/30 100U in am and 60 in pm, but has not been monitoring her BS or taking insulin for the past month. She has all the necessary equipment. She says she tries o monior her carb intake. She has been gaining weight, bout 5 lbs in the past 2 mos, and notes polydypsia and polyuria fo the past 2 weeks.



4. HTN-has not been taking Zestoretic or Atenolol x1 mo



5. Depression-Pt has h/o depression for which she has been medicated in the past. She currently feels she has very depressed mood, apathy, trouble sleeping and with memory tasks. She denies SI/HI/AH.

CCU JAR Admission Note



Name: Etheridge, Shari 

MR: 2931335

Admitting Cardiologist: Travis

PCP: 



Date of Admission to WGH: January 19th, 2087



ID/CC: 84 year-old woman with CAD, CHF, COPD presents with shortness of breath. 



HPI: (Obtained from patient).  Ms. Etheridge has a history of coronary artery disease, stating that she has a    heart problem.     She is unable to give more details at the present time.  Per old records, she carries the diagnosis of CAD and diastolic heart failure EF 55%.  

	She was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission, when she began to complain of    a cold.     She felt chills, even though it was warm in her house.  That day she suffered a mechanical fall, slipping on a blanket in her home.  She hit her left eye, but denies LOC.  The next day, she was    achy    all over, noted a dry cough, and was    wheezy.     The day prior to admission, she states that she    couldn't breath    and had to come into the ER.

On arrival to WGH at 11:30AM 01/18/88 vitals were: P 93  BP 121/82  RR 22  96% on room air.  She had a prolonged ER course of 31 hours duration.  Initially, she was treated for presumed COPD flare with nebulizers, prednisone and doxycycline.  A rapid flu test was positive for influenza A.  She received 1 liter of normal saline.  Approximately 6 hours later, she complained of 7/10 mid sternal chest pain, non-radiating.  EKG showed: sinus tachycardia @115bpm, with STE 1mm AVR, and STD II, V3-V5.  Her pain came to 1/10 with 2L NTG and Ativan.  Small doses of IV lopressor were given.  STDs partially resolved.  Around 10AM the day of admission  (01/19/88) her blood pressure acutely rose to 190 systolics, her heart rate increased to 106bpm.  Per the patient, she remembers having a coughing fit, and being unable to catch her breath.  She was placed on CPAP, then switched to BiPAP for ABG: 125/78/7.13.  She was felt clinically to be in flash pulmonary edema.  She was treated with nebulizers, intravenous TNG, lasix and BiPAP.  With improvement in hemodynamics, her pain and shortness of breath improved.  Enzymes were drawn and showed: trop 0.22, CK 122, MB 11.7.  She was started on heparin, integrillin (though unclear if she received it).

The patient currently denies pain.  She is extremely anxious, refusing blood draws, etc.

A/P: 62 yo F presenting re multiple medical issues. 
1) CAD s/p recent CABG: doing well.  followed closely by Cardiology dr Uphoff. now  finished w cardiac rehab and appears to be doing  very well. mild jaw discomfort (posible anginal equivalent) improving w improved conditioning. Dr. Uphoff aware and has recomemnded ongoing conditioning and close monitring. no further palpitations; she knows to c all if recurrent. recent LDL within goal.  pt confirms 100% adherence to meds. BP elevated today but reoprtedly within goal at PT/rehab and at other doctors appts
---continue asa 81 mg, metoprolol, nifedipine, and prn lasix per Cardiology
---cardiac rehab
---encouraged ongoing healthy eating, wt loss, and exercise (W cardiac rehab
2) DM: most recent 11/06/2137 hgba1c 7.6 % (from 7.8%), nearing goal. Pt w improved FS today esp w increases to lantus ~ 42-48units BID. no episodes of hypoglycemia now that she has stopped the novolog.  will rechecking hgba1c at next visit. recent LDL within goal. 1/2137 urine microalbum to creat within goal.  optho uptodate she will call w any problems, concerns, persistently elevated FS, sxs.  continue to follow closely. applauded and encouraged ongoing wt loss.  2136 pneumovax; 2137 flu shot uptodate

She does not need further invasive testing at this time for low risk surgery.  I will, however, confirm this w her cardiologist to make sure he does have any issues as well with her surgery and add that as an addendum to this note. Pt's BP is mildly elevated today but typically within goal on her current regimen. I will see her back in ~ 2 weeks time, prior to surgery and make sure her BP is well controlled. Pt has no hx to suggest bleeding diathesis but will checking her pt/ptt and cbc today.  Pt will discuss with Dr. Arias regarding when she needs to stop her ASA. she is on this for her CAD so important to resume as soon as possible; I will also confirm w Dr. Uphoff re his opinions re the asa. Diabetes control improving (see above). A copy of this letter along w labs and EKG will be sent to Dr. Arias. 
6) HCM:
----reviewed mammogram: pt wishes to defer for now; understands risks/benefits; she will redisucss at fu visit
----colo: brought upt again today need for screening but pt did not wish to discuss and still &lt;1 year post CABG


Pt to RTC in 2 weeks or sooner.

ID/CC  30 year old with ESRD/HD with facial swelling 

HPI:     This patient presented to the ED with a 1 day h/o facial swelling.  She also reports diffuse abdominal pain x several days; as well as chills at dialysis on Wednesday.  She   s attended all dialysis sessions recently for her full time; she has had two infiltrations that resulted in early removal from the HD machine, but she made up her time on other days.  She feels she has been becoming increasingly volume overloaded for the last 1-2 weeks; she has requested an additional (4th) HD session each week but her OP center has not been able to accommodate her. 

The patient went to Internal Medicine this AM and had a brachicephalic stenosis dilated near the site of a prior stent.  

Past Medical History    adapted from prior notes

	to atelectasis or pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.
	There is a graft like material in the midline that is unchanged in the previous study 
             and may represent an SVC stent.   

ECG: ST @ 92  Axis    78  LAHB 

Impression
Facial swelling, r/o SVC syndrome
  -It is unclear if the stenosis in the brachiocephalic vein explains the facial swelling.

EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. 1st degree AV block. Left axis deviation with likely left anterior fascicular block. No priors available for comparison.



Imaging:

Chest X-Ray: No evidence of pneumonia.



Hip films: Impacted, displaced fracture of the left femoral neck with longitudinal extension of fracture into the intertrochanteric proximal femur. 



TTE 6/77: Mild MR. Left atrium enlarged at 36 mm. Moderate TR with prominent Eustachian valve. Normal LV cavity with EF 64%. Normal RV function with RVSP 44.





Impression:

87F with PMHx of HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, hypothyroidism, chronic venous stasis, and h/o post-op DVT presents with L proximal femur fracture after fall. Patient&#8217;s fall does appear to be mechanical by history. Her RCRI would be Class I-II, placing her at low to intermediate risk for this intermediate risk procedure. Given that she is on beta-blockade, she should be continued with use of short acting beta-blocker (i.e., lopressor) while here in the hospital. Her chronic venous stasis change is likely due to previous bilateral DVTs based on her history. This can be evaluated postoperatively as it may affect decisions regarding potential anticoagulation.



Recommendations:

-          Please change patient from atenolol to lopressor 37.5 mg PO Q8hours, to be held for HR &lt; 55 and SBP &lt; 100

-          Please check ECG postoperatively along with troponin on Day 1 and Day 4 postoperatively

-          Please implement high risk DVT prophylaxis postoperatively with lovenox 30 mg SC BID

-          Please schedule LENIs postoperatively as is tolerated based on surgery. Would need to discuss benefits/risks of ongoing anticoagulation with family if positive



Thank you for this interesting consult. To be staffed today with Dr. Elliot Sexton.

Interim History:	

Comes to review her medical problems.

She has been well overall but has been bothered by trigger finger (R ring). She has seen Dr. Ibarra, who has suggested surgery since a steroid injection did not help.

Brings no test results. No severe hypoglycemia.

Retinopathy:	Saw Dr. Aragon yesterday. Stable. Last laser was about 5 years ago. 1 year.

Nephropathy:	Reports that she cannot do blood tests at KJH since she gets copays. Covered if done at Promptcare. She does not recall when her BUN/Cr were last checked but says that it was prior to January and that results were sent to Dr. Hayes. 

Neuropathy:	Not much troubled by neuropathy.  She still has the sensation of food or liquid getting stuck mid sternal level. BaS last year showed GERD and dysmotility. I am not sure that Reglan would help, but have reluctance to try it in any case because of her long history of depression. 

Cardiac:	She thinks that she may be having dyspnea on exertion that is easier to precipitate than it had been. She has had some sternal discomfort at rest on two occasions while sitting at rest - felt bony. She says that she has been    trying to ignore    the possible increase in dyspnea on exertion. She sees Dr. Dotson in October. 

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Medications: Stopped Quinine; increased Celexa. Did not start simvastatin since did not have blood work done. 



Social History:

Ivory is well. 



Review of Systems: above

Skin: Saw colleague of Dr. Keeler yesterday. Given cream for scalp.

Gyn: Report that Yareli Kilgore will no longer see her for routine follow-up. Periods are regular. Does not use contraception. Has never been pregnant. Discussed this and she left it that she is not worried about it.



Physical Exam:	

Looks well.

BP:   120/76		P:   82, regular

Wt:   161.5 without shoes, stable

HEENT:	Anicteric. 

Carotids:	Normal pulses, without bruits

Chest:	Clear to auscultation

Breasts:	No masses; no nodes	

Nodes:	No cervical, supraclavicular, axillary

Heart:	Normal S1; physiologic S2.  S4.  2/6 systolic ejection murmur

Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness. No palpable AAA. 

Extremities:	No edema.        DP 1-2+,=.  PT absent.   L great toenail appears to be about to be lost, thickened with probable subungual hematoma.

Neurological:	AJ absent.  



Impressions and Plan:	

Will get ETT with imaging. Need approval from her insurance. Call if she has any more convincing cardiac symptoms.

She should see Yareli Holcomb, NP for Pap with history of HPV and abnormal Paps in the past. 

She should see Dr. Xie for foot care. 

Strongly suggest she get some labs in the next week or so, fasting:

A1c, lipids, Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine, CBC, SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, Bili T/D, urinalysis





Appointments:	Yareli Holcomb, NP as above

	Me 4 months

RE:  Wonda Benitez
     MR #892-76-95-4
 
Dear Usha:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients, Ms.
Benitez, in my cardiovascular clinic for follow-up for palpitations,
hypertension, and status post coronary artery bypass surgery.  As
you know, she has been complaining of leg cramps mostly at night. 
She has been taking quinine for this, however develops palpitations
whenever she takes the quinine.  She has not been taking this since
the initial two doses.  I suspect that her leg cramps are probably
secondary to intermittent passing fluxes.  I have told her to eat
a banana during the evening and possibly this would avoid leg
cramps in the evening.  In the meantime, her EKG showed sinus
bradycardia at a rate of 50 per minute.  There is borderline first
degree AV block and anterolateral infarct by EKG which is unchanged
from previous tracing.  We will continue her on Vasotec 10 mg bid
as well as Lopressor 12.5 mg bid.  She will see me in follow-up in
three months' time.
 
Again, thank you for referring this patient to my cardiovascular
clinic.
 
With warm regards.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
 
Gordon Q. Iniguez, M.D.

Ms. Stephenson comes in for discussion of her stress test last week, which 
was positive.  She went 9 minutes and 11 seconds on a modified Bruce to 
a maximum heart rate of 131, which was 81% of predicted.  She had 1mm 
and 2mm ST depressions, which was predictive of significant coronary 
disease.  She continues to have chest pain only when she is exercising 
vigorously, which is rapidly walking.  She vehemently denies that she 
has any chest pain at rest or with less exertion.
 
We began a discussion of what kind of intervention she might like to 
have, and we will continue this over time, but currently she is not 
interested in intervention if we can manage her medically.
 
PLAN:  I will start her today on atenolol 25mg and on an aspirin.  She 
refused nitroglycerine because she did not feel that she had any need 
for taking it.  She will come back in one week to see how her pulse is 
on atenolol.  
 
Today blood pressure was 164/82 and her pulse was 80.  
 
We will increase the atenolol as tolerated.  I will continue to work 
with her strenuously on risk factor modification.  Her other risk 
factors include diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, though 
her cholesterol is current well controlled with an LDL of 95.  Her 
diabetes is not as well controlled, and I think I will consider sending 
her to Olivia Orosco for further management of this.
 
She will return to see me in a week's time, and she understands that hip 
if she has increasing chest pain that she should call me or come to the 
hospital.

MRN:  4067033

ADMIT DATE: 11/22/24

PCP:  Irvin Joshua Morgan, MD

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: William Dugan, MD



CHIEF COMPLAINT

Shortness of breath



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Uribe is a 56 yo man with a history of CHF (EF 61%), COPD, OSA, PulmHTN, HTN, DMII, chronic venous stasis, and morbid obesity presenting to the ED with shortness of breath.  
Patient has had 2 prior admission (2121, 2122) for CHF exacerbations, last admission requiring lasix 80 IV TID to diurese 1-3L/day.  Patient states his dry weight is ~380lbs.  He was recently in Amboy after surgery for nonhealing venous stasis ulcer and returned home in 9/24.  Upon returning home his weight was down to 342 lbs, however upon admission it is 409 lbs.  Patients reports the past 3 weeks he has felt abdominal bloating, increased LE edema and increase dyspnea on exertion.  At baseline he is able to ambulate short distances on his cane however now he is barely able to get up off the toilet. 
He also reports increased drainage from his RLE wound.  He reports medication compliance except for missing 2-3 times over the past several weeks.  He reports increased fluid intake including Progresso soup, ice water, diet coke and a &#8216;dash&#8217; of salt to his food.  At baseline he requires 2L O2 during the day and 4L at night.  His CPAP machine has been broken for the past week.  He typically sleeps on 3 pillows but has recently increased to 4.  He awakes from sleep often feeling short of breath and sits on the edge of his bed to catch his breath.  Today he saw his PCP at Saint Mary's Hospital Fallbright Center for the above complaints and was sent immediately to the urgent care clinic.  From there he was transferred to the HBH ED.



In the ambulance he received 40 mg IV lasix x 1 and had 1L of UOP.  In the ED, VS were HR 106, BP 110/80  RR 20  O2 sat 96% on 5L.  He received another 40mg IV of lasix and put out 800 cc.  Labs revealed a K of 3.1, Mg of 1.4, Hct of 35.4 and BNP of 1625.  K and Mg were repleted.  Diltiazem 30mg po x 1 was given for rapid afib.  CXR showed stable interstitial edema.  Patient was admitted to medicine for further work up.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Mr. Uribe is a 56 yo man with a history of CHF (EF 61%), COPD, OSA, PulmHTN, HTN, DMII, chronic venous stasis, and morbid obesity presenting with shortness of breath likely secondary to CHF exacerbation from right sided failure.  Appears to have class IV disease with symptoms at rest.  BNP is elevated from baseline (584) at 1625 confirming acute exacerbation.  Exacerbation may be from increased Na intake, medicine non-compliance and increased po fluid intake, could also be from anemia.



##: CHF exacerbation &#8211; patient responded well to 40mg IV lasix with UOP of 1 L


Lasix 40mg IV BID titrate to TBB goal of at least -1 L (will likely require more as patient required 80 mg IV TID last admission for CHF)
 
Monitor strict I/O&#8217;s
 
Daily weight (dry weight)
 
Na restrict to 2gm, fluid restrict to 2L/day
 
Continue lisinopril and verapamil for rate control
 
O2 therapy, titrate as indicated
 
If fails to improve with aggressive diuresis, consider PE CT given history of immobility



##: Anemia &#8211; iron studies last done in 2116.


Check Fe, TIBC, ferritin, retic count



##: Diabetes


Hold metformin
 
AC and HS finger sticks
 
Regular insulin sliding scale



##: Venous stasis ulcer


Continue BID ace wraps with calcium algenate and ABDs per vascular surgery
 
Patient has appt Thursday. w/Dr. Roe &#8211; will notify of admission



##: OSA


CPAP will inpatient; will attempt to assist patient obtaining working machine for at home

REPORT
     BILATERAL MAMMOGRAM
     The present study is compared to previous films.
     There are scattered fibroglandular densities.
     There is architectural distortion and skin and trabecular
     thickening involving the left breast that are consistent with post
     treatment changes.  There is no evidence of new or recurrent
     disease.
     No suspicious mass, calcifications or architectural distortion are
     identified in the right breast.  A clip and calcifications are
     noted in the upper outer quadrant from prior benign percutaneous
     biopsy.
     There is no mammographic evidence of malignancy in the right
     breast.
     

IMPRESSION
     Post treatment changes involving the left breast with no evidence
     of new or recurrent disease.
     No mammographic evidence of malignancy in the right breast.
     BI-RADS Category 2 Benign Finding

Impression and Plan:

1) Uncontrolled DM: A bit improved. Now with premeal values mostly in low 200s. Will increase to 1000 mg qpm since her AM values seem to be higest. Eventually will need to be on maximal doses of metformin (2550 mg qd). Hypoglycemic event management reviewed.
Still with frequent dietary indiscretions, such as eating candy and pizza on regular basis.

2) Diet modification reviewed.

3) HTN/proteinuria: Not optimally controlled. WIll add atenolol for now. Rationale for this reviewed with pt. Cont. ACEI and adjust next time based on microalbumin. Previously referred to renal for eval.

4) Osteoporosis: Stable. Cont. Fosamax. Reviewd proper use-drinking of water and staying upright for at least 30 minutes after taking pill.

5) Smoking: 5 cigs per day per pt. Risks and options discussed. Urged cessation. 

6) H/o breast cancer: Stable. F/u with Queen Newton 9/73 and Dr.Mitchell 12/73.

7) abnormal LFTs: recheck in a couple of months.

8) H/o noncompliance: reviewed in detail with pt. ""busy schedule of appts"". Urged compliance.

Encounter 40 min. more than 1/2 of it in face to face review of meds, education/counseling about DM management, rationale for medical regimen, HTN, compliance issues, smoking cessation and above.

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Leg swelling and pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 78-year-old female who 

is on chronic prednisone for rheumatoid arthritis, who comes in 

with left leg swelling and pain going on for two days, and she was 

sent in for evaluation.  There has been no change in range of 

motion.  She has been able to ambulate, but with difficulty and 

limping.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  She does have a history of Staphylococcus 

aureus infection of the right side.  She also has 

non-insulin-dependent diabetes, vasculitis and neuropathy.  She is 

status post multiple joint operations.

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  No tobacco or ETOH.  She lives 

alone.  Family history is noncontributory.   Please see the 

resident's note for the rest of the details.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Awake, alert, very pleasant female 

in no apparent distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  Her temperature is 98.  Her 

normal temperature is about 96.5.  She is not tachycardic.

Since last seen, she apparently was without evidence of increasing BUN and creatinine and for this reason was advised to transiently hold both her lisinopril and Zaroxolyn.  By doing so, her creatinine fell from 2.2 to 1.6 and BUN from 117 to 57.  She subsequently has resumed her lisinopril therapy, as apparently her blood pressure increased off her ACE inhibitor.  In addition, as part of her followup last March, she underwent an adenosine MIBI stress test during which time she achieved a peak heart rate of 65, peak blood pressure of 129/50, stopping because she reached the end of the adenosine infusion protocol.  Her gated SPECT imaging demonstrated a global left ventricular ejection fraction of 38% with a mildly dilated left ventricle and akinesis of the basal inferoseptal and entire inferior wall.  Her rest-stress perfusion imaging showed similarly a large fixed perfusion defect in the inferior and basal inferoseptal wall without any area of reversible ischemia.  Her last echocardiogram performed in July 2071 showed a residual of left ventricular ejection fraction mildly reduced at 45% with severe inferoseptal and inferior hypokinesis.  In addition, at that time showed evidence for trivial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and her echo was essentially unchanged from her prior study in March 2071.



Currently, she is concerned primarily about her inability to lose weight, and in fact states that during a recent vacation she actually discontinued her diet.  Presently, she continues on a regimen of Toprol-XL 37.5 mg p.o. daily, simvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily, lisinopril 5 mg p.o. daily, potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d., furosemide 160 mg p.o. b.i.d., Coumadin, enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily, Niferex 150 mg p.o. daily, Humulin N 20 units subcutaneous q.a.m. and Humulin N 20 units subcutaneous q.p.m.



Physical exam reveals a pleasant, mildly overweight woman in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 120/52, heart rate 45 and irregularly regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 253 pounds, which is 12 pounds above her weight of six months ago.  The neck is supple.  JVP is flat.  Carotids are without significant bruits.  Chest remains clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with a soft systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base.  No significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is overweight, but otherwise benign without evidence of abdominal aneurysm or bruit.  Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema.  Peripheral pulses are detectable, albeit mildly diminished.



Electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation flutter with at times of significant AV block with pauses as high as approximately 2 seconds.  There is evidence of a prior inferior myocardial infarction and minor nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.  Compared with her last electrocardiogram, her heart rate at times is slower.



Impression:  Ms. Joshi remains stable from a cardiovascular perspective, however, I am obviously concerned about her potential for lightheadedness in light of her bradycardia.  I have asked her to decrease her Toprol-XL to 25 mg p.o. daily and to repeat an EKG four to five days after doing so.  I of course have reminded her as to the importance of getting in contact with you or myself straight away should she develop any symptoms suggestive of lightheadedness or dizziness.  She understands that she may require a permanent pacemaker in the future.  Most recent blood studies show a significantly elevated glucose of 183 (she states she is trying to tailor her insulin regimen with you) and in January, normal liver function studies except for an alkaline phosphatase of 304 and lipid profile last September notable for a cholesterol of 134, triglyceride of 74, HDL 58, and LDL 61.  She understands the importance of continuing to adhere to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet while remaining on her antilipemic therapy.  She will discuss with you and her nephrologist the optimal management of her mild renal insufficiency.  In light of both her diabetes and coronary disease, it certainly would be optimal if possible to continue her on her ACE inhibitor.  At the present time, she does not meet criteria for prophylactic placement of an AICD and her New York Heart Association class I to II status precludes the need for consideration of biventricular pacing.  Other than reducing her beta-blocker regimen as described above, I have not further altered her current medical program.



I thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.



Sincerely yours,







Brandon W Neilson, M.D.

EDVISIT^43471375^KIMBROUGH, AMELIA^08/09/59^STEELE, SHAYLYN

This patient was seen with resident, Dr. Penn, whose note was

reviewed and confirmed by me.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46-year-old woman with

end-stage renal disease secondary to minimal chain disease, on

hemodialysis, presenting with severe hypertension, headache,

nausea, and vomiting in the setting of blood pressures in the

200s/100s today.

Please review resident's note for full details of past medical

history, social history, review of systems, medications, and

allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I confirm the physical exam is as

documented.  The patient is awake, alert, and appears to be in

mild to moderate discomfort.  Vital signs reveal pulse of 108,

respirations 22, blood pressure 226/129, and oximetry is 96% on

room air.  The patient is afebrile.  HEENT exam reveals well

visualized disks bilaterally on funduscopic exam.  There is no

papilledema noted.  Posterior pharynx is clear.  Lungs are clear

to auscultation with good air movement throughout.  Heart is

regular.  Abdomen is soft.  Extremity exam reveals no cyanosis,

clubbing, or edema.  Neurologic:  The patient is intact.  There

is a left brachiocephalic shunt noted with a good thrill easily

palpable.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count is 5.4, hematocrit 45, BUN and

creatinine 31 and 6.0, potassium is noted at 5.3%, cardiac

enzymes flat, and coags are unremarkable.

IMAGING STUDIES:  EKG is sinus rhythm without any ST or T-wave

changes concerning for ischemia.  Head CT shows no acute

processes.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was given IV fluids and

treated with Zofran for her nausea, labetalol 200 mg p.o.

followed by 10 mg intravenously, which brought her pressure down

very nicely to 168/86.  After fluids, Zofran, and blood pressure

control, her symptoms improved dramatically.  She was admitted to

the Observation Unit to monitor her blood pressure overnight with

anticipated discharge in the morning.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

DIAGNOSIS:  Hypertensive urgency.

Ulysses Peralta, M.D.
82 March Street
Coalinga, FL  84635


Dear Dr. Peralta:


I saw your patient, Dr. Gipson, in the Cardiology Office today on a somewhat urgent basis.  He was recently in Italy last week with very difficult events concerning his father's ill health.  His father ultimately died and was a very traumatic series of days for Dr. Gipson and his family.  He developed left chest discomfort, which persisted for a number of days.  He was afraid to take nitroglycerin despite knowing that he should, and therefore remained with chest discomfort for about six days.  He was able to be reasonably active and had no exacerbation of his chest discomfort.  He had no nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or palpitations.  He then returned to the United States and his symptoms have resolved.  Because of these discomforts, he wanted to undergo an additional evaluation.


We performed an exercise treadmill test with perfusion imaging two days ago for better understanding of his symptoms.  He exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds on the standard Bruce protocol to a peak heart rate of 122 beats per minute (84% of maximum predicted for age) and peak blood pressure of 162/80.  He stopped because of dyspnea and had some discomfort.  The discomfort resolved into recovery.  He had no ST segment changes.  His perfusion scan demonstrated normal LV size and normal tracer uptake in the lungs.  There was normal RV size as well.  There was a small-to-medium medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior wall that was reversible.  These were no different than the prior study he had in July 2061.


As you may remember, in January 2061, he underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated the presence of non-major flow-limiting obstructions and so no intervention was performed.


His current medical regimen includes ramipril 5 mg b.i.d., aspirin 162 mg daily, Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d., Crestor 10 mg daily, fish oil 500 mg b.i.d., metformin 500 mg b.i.d., multivitamins, niacin 500 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Toprol-XL 100 mg b.i.d., HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, and Nexium.


On exam today, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 135/75, a heart rate of 60 and regular, and weight of 189 pounds.  Head and neck are unremarkable.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.  There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.  Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.  Bowel sounds are normal.  The extremities show no edema or cyanosis.  Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.  Distal pulses are normal.


His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm and normal morphology.


I think Dr. Gipson is basically doing very well.  I think his chest discomforts for six days while in Italy may be related to anxiety and perhaps the known gastroesophageal reflux disease that he has.  I think there is no evidence that the discomfort was cardiac in origin.  His exercise capacity is quite good and his perfusion is actually somewhat even improved from his prior evaluation two years ago.  I think we can maintain our current approach.  I suggest that I see him in a number of months for future evaluation.


If any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.


Kindest regards.


Sincerely yours,

IDENTIFICATION:  A 71-year-old woman who presents to follow up diabetes.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  I received the patient's recent blood work and asked her to come in for a short-term followup.  Her hemoglobin A1c is 11.1.  We discussed her current system for managing her blood sugar.  She notes 100% compliance in using her NPH insulin, 45 units in the morning, 40 in the evening.  She is taking 2 shots of Humalog, on average, in the morning and just before bedtime.  She is doing 2 fingersticks a day, in the morning fasting and before bed.  She notes recent indiscretions in terms of her calorie intake.  She checked her fingerstick this morning, but cannot remember the result.  She is fully compliant with her other medications.  She was on simvastatin in the past, which was stopped because of liver test elevations.  She was on Crestor in the past, which was stopped at the time of a hospitalization when her CK was noted to be elevated.  Today, she is having no fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, dysuria, leg swelling, or leg numbness.

AMITRIPTYLINE HCL - urinary retention
GABAPENTIN - memory loss


Vital Signs
BP 126/68 L Arm, P 69, Temp 98.0, Wt 235.0 lb




PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is in no distress.  Her initial blood pressure, as she walked down the hall, was 154/71.  Repeating this after sitting was 126/68.  Lungs:  Clear.  Cardiac:  Regular.  Extremities:  Trace edema.



ASSESSMENT:  Uncontrolled adult onset diabetes.  Care for this will be challenging due to the patient's cognitive problems.  She does use Valley Hospital Web Services.  We discussed to start frequent communication via Web Services of test results will be helpful for me in helping her adjust insulin.  We discussed the possibility of changing from NPH to Lantus insulin, but elected to continue her NPH for now.  We discussed that her use of the ultra-fast acting insulin does not quite make sense.  She is taking an injection in the evening, long after her meal.  I asked her to describe her meals and she has carbohydrates essentially with every meal.  I think initially she can easily tolerate 10 units of Humalog with each meal.  She notes that she prefers to inject the insulin after she eats, which is acceptable as long she does it within a few minutes of the meal.  She currently is using an average of 15 units, so this will increase her total daily insulin use by just 15 units.  I asked her to check 3 fingersticks a day for me and to e-mail them on a daily basis to start.  She will check a fasting fingerstick.  She will check a fingerstick before her evening meal, which is her largest meal of the day.  She will check a fingerstick 2 hours after her evening meal.  She does not need to check a fingerstick right before bed.  She will stop using Humalog right before bed and only use the NPH at that time.  We discussed the importance of cholesterol treatment.  Her last LDL was over 100.  I would like to revisit the idea of using a statin.  I will repeat her CK level to see if this remains elevated.  Her blood pressure on recheck is acceptable.  I will see her back in the office in 2 months rather than what is booked now.  Most of our visit today took place together with her husband.  We spent a total of 25 minutes with more than half the time spent in counseling.

	Interval History:
   It is a pleasure seeing Mrs. Xuereb in f/u s/p her PFO closure on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Crybiform Amplatzer device.  
Her history is also signigicant for s/p STEMI the morning after arthroscopic shoulder surgery for adhesive capsulitis in 10/63, Protein S deficiency, COPD, HTN and dyslipidemia. 

She is doing well from the cardiac perspective-reporting that her PAC's have decreased in intensity and occurance-now happening 2-3x/day, and denies any further neurological events. 

She does, however, c/o a constant HA (feels as though her head is in a 'vice'), did not have pre-procedure. She does have a hx. of migraines, and reports that she has not had one since her closure. She is using Tylenol w/ good relief.  Thinks it is d/t the Toprol XL.

	Other Data:
   1/26/64-TTE:
MITRAL VALVE 
There is no evidence of mitral valve prolapse. There is mild mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler. 
LEFT ATRIUM 
There is no evidence of left atrial dilatation. 
AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT 
There is no evidence of valvular aortic stenosis. The aortic valve is tricuspid. There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral Doppler. 
LEFT VENTRICLE 
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. The left ventricular systolic function is within normal limits. There are no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities. There is a false tendon within the LV cavity which is a normal variant. The estimated ejection fraction is 65 %. 
TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC 
There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of mild tricuspid insufficiency. 
PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A. 
There is evidence of trace pulmonary insufficiency by color and spectral Doppler. The RV systolic pressure was estimated from the regurgitant tricuspid velocity (assuming an RA pressure of 10mmHg). The estimated RV systolic pressure is 33 mmHg. 
RIGHT VENTRICLE 
The right ventricle is not dilated. The right ventricular systolic function is within normal limits. 
INTERATRIAL SEPTUM, INTERVENTRICULAR SEPTUM 
There are increased echoes along the interatrial septum c/w a closure device. The appearance of the device is most c/w an Amplatzer device. There is evidence of a patent foramen ovale by agitated saline contrast after Valsalva maneuver. 
PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES 
There is no evidence of pericardial effusion. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Compared to the report of 12/06/2063, there is residual shunt with the valsalva manuever. 




	Assessment and plan:
   In summary, Xian is a 56-year-old female s/p myocardial infarction, likely the result of paradoxical emboli via a large PFO, and s/p closure of her PFO on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Crybiform Amplatzer device.  She is doing well from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events.  Upon our review of the echocardiogram there is a trace shunt across the device (7 beats, only after Valsalva) consistent w/ intra-pulmonary shunting.  We are willing to try decreasing her Toprol XL to 12.5mg qd, in an attempt to alleviate her HA's.  If this proves unsucessful, we will trial a course of Atenolol.  We agree with continuation of her ASA therapy and will see her in f/u for her 6 month appointment in June w/ an Echo w/ bubbles.

                                                       Patient Name: ROBISON,NEIL [ MRN: 013423CA ]

                                                         Date of Visit: 04/27/81









Mr. Robison comes to clinic today for f/u after being hospitalized for central pontine CVA in early April.  He has been working with OT, speech therapy and nutrition at home, with some improvement in gait and fine motor skills.  He still feels like his speech is poor and his right hand is not working at baseline.  Other complaints include a HA every morning which is global and tends to improve over the course of the day with tylenol.  He does admit to some visual changes that have been occuring for about one year--transient decreased vision in right eye, lasting for several minutes to hours and happening about twice per week.  He saw an ophthamologist in 12/02 who, per the patient, found no abnormalities.  He also states that he has had nonproductive cough with chest congestion for about 2 weeks. No fevers, chills, n/v or diarrhea.  Some rhinorrhea but no sinus sxs.  He has had difficulty with muscle cramps since his BMT which respond well to gatorade.  The nutritionist is not thrilled with the high salt content of gatorade.  We discussed the possibility of drinking less gatorade and adding a banana daily. 



MEDS:

lopressor 25 TID

coumadin 5 QHS



PE: 97.1   66   144/90, repeat 130/90    wt 225

gen: NAD, slightly dysarthric

neuro: CNII-XII intact except for slight right mouth droop; strength is 5/5 both upper and lower extremities; biceps and patellar DTRs 2+ symmetrically; gait is steady, but heel to toe is unsteady

CV: distant RRR without murmurs

Pulm: soft bibasilar crackles; no wheezes, rhonchi or areas of consolidation. no dullness to percussion

Skin: flaking over forehead and nasal bridge with slight redness

Rectal: erythema perirectally without bleeding or hemorrhoids. sl decreased rectal tone, no tenderness guaic neg brown stool







Labs: 4/22 INR 2.8

4/26: CBC, Chem 7, coags pending



A/P: 53 yo man with h/o lymphoma s/p allo BMT in 10/78 c/b chronic skin GVHD, pseudomonal pna and post herpetic neuralgia who was recently hospitalized with central pontine CVA.  Trans thoracic echo, spiral CT and carotid ultrasound did not reveal embolic source.  MRI showed right MCA cut off with collateral flow.  His sxs of dysarthria and right hand dysfunction seem to be slowly improving with OT, speech therapy. Daily HA are concerning.  

--repeat head CT to rule out progression of infarct or bleed into infarct territory. Pt may need another MRI in future, but is wary of MRI and may require open machine

--pt has neuro follow up at the end of May.  We need to discuss with the neurologist the duration of anti-coagulation

--check coags, CBC, Chem 7 today; adjust coumadin prn

--increase lopressor to 50 BID and continue BP monitoring by VNA

--pt has f/u with his primary oncologist Dr. Savage at RGSC on 5/6. 

--no abx at this time for cough without focal pulm findings and abscence of fever. Follow closely

--have asked pt to make another ophtho appt to eval visual changes in right eye (which apparently have been happening for a year and have not been progressive)

--RTC in 3 weeks to review CT results and lab tests.

FERRARA,LAUREN   481-85-43-7                       VISIT DATE: 08/07/59

I have examined and treated the patient myself as well as reviewed 

and confirmed the resident's detailed documentation.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Briefly, this 68-year-old woman 

with a history of diabetes and a past history of ulcers on the 

right foot complains of increased pain on the right leg over the 

past three days.  It was worse yesterday.  It was slightly better 

today.  She has not really been able to get out of bed secondary to 

the pain, whereas she is usually very active.  She denies fever, 

chills, palpitations, and diarrhea.  She has not recently checked 

her blood sugar.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, dementia, 

chronic ulcer of left great toe.  Past surgical history:  

Hysterectomy in the distant past.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.2, pulse 70, 

respirations 18.  Blood pressure was initially 241/90.  HEENT:  

Within normal limits.  NECK:  Within normal limits.  LUNGS:  Within 

normal limits.  HEART:  Normal except for a 3/6 systolic ejection 

murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  Normal pulses 

throughout except that most of the pulses are heard only by 

Doppler, and on the left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses 

there is no Doppler pulse available.  The lower extremities are 

both cool and somewhat modeled to the mid thigh.  Toes are somewhat 

dusky.  There is a 5 x 5-mm shallow ulcer on the medial aspect of 

the left great toe.  

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The Orthopedic Service was 

consulted and did AVIs and PVRs which indicated an ischemic lower 

extremity with a question of aortoiliac disease versus thrombus.

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Orthopedic Service.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Arterial insufficiency.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

being admitted to the Orthopedic Service, is not being heparinized 

at present; and a decision of angiography or MRA will be 

considered.  The patient was admitted to the hospital in stable 

condition.

NAME:    Justus, Quiana

MRN:     9814048



The patient comes in today for follow up of several medical problems. She has a

history of type 2 diabetes. Her sugars have not been optimally controlled. They are

usually in the 190-200 range in the morning. Her weight is stable. She has no lower

extremity numbness or weakness.  



She has a history of hyperlipidemia. She stopped her Lescol 2 weeks ago because it

was expensive. She also never increased the dose above 20 mg. She has had side

effects with atorvastatin and pravastatin in the past. Please see her allergy list in

LMR.



She has a half sister who had colon cancer at age 88. Quiana has had rare

occasional blood streaking when she wipes herself after being constipated. She is

aware of what a colonoscopy is but absolutely refuses a colonoscopy. She is aware

that she is at increased risk for colon cancer given her family history. She has no

nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena or weight loss.



She has chronic lower back pain and bilateral leg pain that is probably due to spinal

stenosis. She has lower back pain and pain in her legs that is worse with walking. It

helps when she uses a carriage to walk around in the store. She denies lower

extremity numbness, change in her bowel or bladder, fevers or chills. Her last MRI

was done in Walsenburg in a wide body machine and was consistent with spinal stenosis. 

She has taken Ultram. She is aware that Vioxx may increase people's risk for cardiac

disease and has stopped taking it. Dr. Yeager, her rheumatologist, referred her to Dr.

North in Internal Medicine for possible injections. 



PHYSICAL EXAM: No acute distress. Her blood pressure is 180/90. However, her

daughter,Iyanna Field, checks her blood pressure at home and it is very well controlled. 

The patient gets very anxious here in the clinic. Neck supple without JVD or bruits.

Lungs clear without wheezes, rales or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular,

normal S1, S2 without S3, S4 or murmurs. No C/C/E. Distal pulses intact.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)  Type 2 diabetes. Check hemoglobin A1c. Continue current medications.



(2)  Hyperlipidemia. She should be on medication to keep her LDL below 100. She

     said that she would resume the medication.



(3)  Hypertension which is never well controlled on her visits here. Her daughter is

     a nursing professional and does report that her blood pressure is very well controlled

     in the 120/80 range when she checks at home. We will continue her current

     regimen.



(4)  Lower back pain. Probably secondary to spinal stenosis. She has an

     appointment with Dr. North.

Neurology Clinic Follow-up



ID:  50 RHM s/p large R MCA stroke 10/20/69 with subsequent hemicraniectomy complicated by abdominal and head wound infections



HPI:  Patient presented initially 10/20/69 after a fall due to the acute onset of left-sided weakness.  Head CT showed hypodensity in the R MCA territory, and CTA revealed R ICA occlusion.  The patient was admitted to the neuroICU.  Follow-up head CT the morning after admission revealed hypodensity involving the entire R MCA territory.  Because of malignant swelling, he went on to require hemicraniectomy which was performed by the Simmons Neurosurgery service.  He recovered and was discharged to rehab on 10/28 with left hemiplegia and dense left-sided neglect.  Aspirin was prescribed for stroke prophylaxis but was subsequently stopped at rehab for unclear reasons.



His stroke work-up revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hr Holter monitor.  A hypercoagulability panel was negative.  Homocysteine was normal.  Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.



The patient was re-admitted on 12/02 with an abdominal bone flap infection.  The flap was removed and long-term antibiotics prescribed.  He did well and then was re-admitted 01/01 with fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting.  His hemicraniectomy site revealed protruding brain which required revision in the OR.  Long-term antibiotics were again prescribed for possible infection of the site.  The patient did well, but routine follow-up MRI of the cranium on 3/8 shows a large, rim-enhancing, DWI bright fluid collection adjacent to the hemicraniectomy site.  This may represent abscess.  Dr. Bennett, Simmons Neurosurgery attending, intends to admit Mr. Rico 3/27 for fluid sampling and culture.  Additional operative intervention may be indicated if this fluid collection is indeed infected.  Patient denies fever or chills.  He has had headaches frequently during the past couple of weeks.  This was a major problem early in his course but then resolved.



Mr. Rico has now been out of rehab for 2 months, and he is doing quite well.  He is able to walk with the assistance of a four-post cane.  His appetite is good, and he sleeps well on trazodone.  He has a very close family who is intimately involved in his medical care.  His spirits have been good considering the ordeal he has recently been through.  While in rehab, his wife apparently deserted him after accruing a great deal of credit card debt from gambling.  He cries when he tells me about this.  A close female friend has moved in to his home and cares for him 24 hours a day.  He is able to assist with ADLs but cannot function independently.  His left leg has some strength, but his arm remains completely paralyzed.  There are occasional twitches in the thumb that are not voluntary.



He has had a great deal of left shoulder pain related to subluxation at that joint.  An orthopedist suggested that the family consider shoulder fusion at some point in the future when the patient has recovered maximal function in the arm.  He also has occasional hip pain on the same side that is less bothersome.  Neurontin has been helpful for the shoulder pain, though the family believes that higher doses lead to a depressed mood.  They are trying to decrease the amount of Dilaudid he uses. 



PMHx:

-stroke as above

-HTN

-hyperlipidemia

-DM



Meds:

-Zestril 5

-trazodone 150

-Avandia 4

-Glucophage 1000 bid

-insulin

-Neurontin 400 bid

-Zantac

-Lopressor 50 bid

-Dilaudid 2 tid

-Lidoderm patch to L shoulder

-Pravachol 20

-Paxil 20

-folate, B vitamins



All:  Allegra -> unknown reaction



SoHx:  Lives with daughter and female friend.  Former RN.  No substance use of any kind.



Exam:

Gen - BP 120/75.  Pulse 56 and regular.  Well-appearing.

MS - alert and fully oriented, fluent and conversant, attentive, aware of current events.  Mood is labile with crying or laughing as appropriate.

CN - PERRL, EOMI, VFF with marked left-sided visual neglect, L face droop, tongue midline, SCM strong, unable to elevate shoulder on left, facial sensation intact

Motor - 5/5 strength throughout on right, L arm flaccid with 0/5 strength throughout, L leg with 2-3/5 proximal strength, otherwise 0/5 

Sens - intact to light touch throughout with marked extinction to DSS

Reflex - brisk on the left side with upgoing toe; otherwise normal

Coord - normal FNF on the left

Gait - hemiplegic with circumduction of left leg, quite stable with cane



Imp/Plan:   s/p R MCA stroke with hemicraniectomy, recovering nicely.  Potentially infected fluid collection at site of hemicraniectomy.  No evidence of systemic infection.  Subluxation of L shoulder.

1.  Admit for neurosurgical management as discussed.  Bone prosthesis will be placed at some point in the future (when possibility of infection is definitively ruled out or treated).

2.  Should be on aspirin for stroke/MI prophylaxis, but will discuss with Dr. Bennett before starting.

3.  Continue aggressive BP/lipid management.

4.  For neuropathic pain in the shoulder, will try Elavil 25 qhs.  Patient will stop trazodone.  If Elavil is helpful, may increase to 50 qhs after one week of therapy.  Once Elavil up to 50 qhs, would slowly taper Neurontin as per patient and family preference.  At next appointment, if persistent left arm paralysis (which is likely), will encourage surgical fusion of the shoulder.

5.  Follow-up in 3 months.

Problems

Pernicious anemia : In 3/64 HCT was 28 with B12 195. All other parameters nl. Has been getting monthly IM B12. Still feels tired. Will check HCT today. 



Hyperlipidemia : Dr. Qu recently changes lipitor to lopid. Dietary non-compliance and poor DM control not helping lipids. 5/05/64: Recently increased to 40 mg qd and fasting chol checked today.



Diabetes mellitus : Good control. Check A1c today.



Depression : Her brother died recently and he was her main companion. She seems to be grieving appropriately but is somewhat isolated without much in the way of social or other activities. Has lost about 9# since 10/63 due to poor appetite. Does not wish to take any more meds. I will see her more frequently.

	Interval History:
   Mr Innis is a 77 y.o male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and CAD.

He did well until August 2096 when he presented with a dull mid scapular discomfort that radiated to his upper chest. These symptoms were accompanied by diaphoresis, dyspnea and transient blurry vision. After evaluation and clearance by Neurology he underwent another cardiac catheterization. Catheterization revealed his LAD stent was patent but he had a 90% lesion proximal to the stent. He had PTCA/Vision stent to his LAD. 

Since 11/19/2096 he has had complaints of increasing dyspnea on exertion and chest pressure. He was treated with antibiotics and prednisone with relief of his dyspnea. He continues with daily exertional chest discomfort that resolves with rest and sl nitroglycerin. 

Today he presented for elective cardiac catheterization which show ed a proximal 90% occlusion and mild In stent restenosis. He had a cypher stent placed in his LAD. He arrived in Cardiology pain free and hemodynamically stable.

NAME:    Justus, Quiana
MRN:       9814048

Quiana is a 73-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes and spinal stenosis who
comes in for a physical.  She has spinal stenosis as documented by her prior MRI's. 
She can usually walk about 5 minutes and then develops pain in her thighs and
calves.  She has some knee pain with walking, but it is not consistent and does not
occur after short 5-minute distances.  The thigh and calf pain resolve with rest.  She
does not always have back pain with the thigh and calf pain.  She also has occasional
right lateral foot pain that feels like an achy arthritic pain in her foot.  She takes
Vioxx occasionally for that foot pain.  She does not have any dysesthesias or
numbness in her feet or hands.  She has no recent trauma, fevers or chills.  She has
no change in her bowel or bladder.

She has type 2 diabetes.  She has been taking Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.  Her weight is
stable.  She does get annual ophthalmology evaluations.  

She has a history of hypertension. She has not had any chest pain, PND, orthopnea,
dyspnea on exertion or edema.  Her blood pressure is never well controlled when she
comes for her visits here, but her daughter, Iyanna Field, a nurse takes her
blood pressure at home and she reports that it is typically 120/70.  She is currently on
Propranolol LA 160 2 tabs p.o. q.d., Dyazide 1 tab p.o. q.d., Captopril 50 mg t.i.d.

She has a history of hyperlipidemia.  She was intolerant of Lipitor in the past.  She
has been taking the Lopid 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. without complications.  She does not do
regular breast self-exams but has not noted any masses.  She is status-post
menopause.  We discussed DEXA bone density scanning, but she did not want to do
it at this time.

We also discussed colon cancer screening.  For now she elects to do stool guaiacs x 3. 
She has not had any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena or hematochezia, abdominal
pain or weight loss.    

Please see her complete medication update in the LMR. 

SOCIAL HISTORY: She is married.  She drinks occasional but not excessive alcohol. 
She does not smoke.  There is no history of domestic abuse.

FAMILY HISTORY: Please see family history update in the LMR.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative.

She has not had a recent tetanus shot.

PHYSICAL EXAM: She is a very pleasant woman in no acute distress. Her blood
pressure here is 150/90.  Her neck is supple without JVD or bruits.  Lungs are clear
without wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  Her breasts are without masses or adenopathy. 
Her cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2 without S3, S4 or
murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.  She is
moderately obese.  Her rectal exam is without masses.  She has no spinal tenderness
on palpation.  Her lower extremity strength is 5/5.  She does not have any peripheral
edema.  Her distal pulses are 2+.  Her sensation is intact to light touch in her feet.  

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  

(1)  Back pain with calf and thigh pain with walking.  This is probably due to her
     spinal stenosis.  However, she is at risk for claudication given her diabetes,
     hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  We will check lower extremity noninvasive
     arterial studies to rule out claudication.  She can take the Vioxx p.r.n. for her
     foot pain which I do not think is related.

(2)  Type 2 diabetes.  She needs a hemoglobin A1c.  Her blood pressure ideally
     should be under 130/85.  She reports that it is consistently below that level
     when her daughter checks it.  She needs as chem-7.  She has no evidence for
     neuropathy at this time.

(3)  Health maintenance.  She needs a tetanus shot which she was given today. 
     Will check stool guaiacs x 3.  

We discussed calcium supplementation for osteoporosis prevention.  She will follow
up in six months and p.r.n.  She has not had a recent tetanus shot. She was given a
tetanus shot in the left deltoid without complications.

History of Present Illness: This was the first Internal Medicine clinic visit for 
this 38-year-old black male with a history of non-insulin dependent 
diabetes diagnosed a year ago, maintained on Diabeta 5 mg. q.d.  Also 
with a history of borderline hypertension previously on 
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. q.d. for the last year, which he discontinued 
last Sunday, who now comes in because over the last two to three weeks 
he has been having trouble with increased dizziness and headaches, and 
he is afraid that his sugar is up.  He states that over the last two or 
three weeks, he gets stars and floaters and sometimes halos of light 
followed by mild headaches.  He says that the visual changes are usually 
accompanied by the headache, and the headache is usually relieved with 
Excedrin in 5 minutes to an hour.  He does admit to a history of 
migraines but states that in the past his migraines have been much more 
severe than this, though the visual aura is very similar to his previous 
migraine aura.  
 
He states that he was seen in the emergency room on 1-12, at which time 
they did a finger stick which was about 180, and they told him to come 
to this appointment at this time.  He denies any fevers.  He does have a 
recent 25 lb weight gain and he admits to new nocturia of 2-3 times a 
night over the last three weeks.  He also has been complaining of 
diarrhea two or three times a week over the last two to three weeks, 
which is watery in nature without any blood.  He has no nausea or 
vomiting or any fever, and he has never had problems with diarrhea like 
this in the past.  His past medical history is otherwise benign.  
 
Habits:  He does have a history of cocaine abuse, and while he was free 
basing about one year ago, he came into the emergency room with chest 
pain and was told that this was secondary to lack of oxygen to his heart 
from the cocaine, since which time he has been using cocaine much less 
frequently.  He denies any tobacco use, and he drinks alcohol socially.  
He is currently unemployed and lives with his mother.  He is sexually 
active with one sexual partner and denies any other risk factors.
 
Family History:  His family history is notable for a grandmother with 
diabetes and hypertension, mother with heart disease and father with 
history of breast CA, who is currently getting radiation therapy here.  
His oldest brother died of street violence and his younger brother is 
alive and well without any medical problems. 
 
Physical Examination;  He is a mildly obese black male in no acute 
distress with weight of 270 lbs.  Blood pressure 138/88 in the right arm 
and 132/94 in the left arm.  Pulse regular at about 80.  HEENT was 
notable for normal fundi without any evidence of diabetic retinopathy or 
hypertensive retinopathy.  Oropharynx was clear.  He had no thyromegaly.  
His chest was clear.  His breasts showed no masses or discharge, and his 
                                              1-29-62
 
 
 
heart sounds were normal.  His abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, 
without any hepatosplenomegaly.  Genitalia: normal, with bilaterally 
descended testes, and his rectal exam was normal tone with brown trace 
heme positive stool.  Neurologic exam was intact. 
 
Assessment and Plan:  
 
1.   Non-insulin dependent diabetes with possible symptoms of increased 
     sugar at this time.  Will check a fasting blood sugar tomorrow 
     morning as well as a hemoglobin A1C, and may increase his Diabeta 
     to 10 mg. q.d.  He will be referred to a nutritionist for diet 
     control as well.  
2.   Hypertension: borderline hypertension at this time off meds.  I 
     will recheck his blood pressure in a week to two weeks, and if it 
     is still borderline at that time, will follow only with a low-salt 
     diet.  
3.   Trace heme positive stool: may be from his diarrhea.  I will get a 
     stool culture and O&P since the diarrhea is persistent for two to 
     three weeks, and follow it at this time.
4.   Patient requesting HIV test: and HIV counseling was given at this 
     point, and a test will be drawn, and I will give him the result 
     when it is back, though I feel that he is very low risk at this 
     time.

Syncope

He was admitted to Leake County Memorial Hospital in December-January 2077. It was thought that he was symptomatic because of dehydration. Had frank sync 1/10,77, and also Nov 18 lost consciousness. There was no sense of TIA or unsteadiness on his feet. He has a carotid bruit and was scheduled to have another ultrasound in the last few months. However, no ultrasound is at hand. Three or four years ago there was insignificant carotid disease documented. Has no symptoms now, no dizziness, sync, but + bruit, and distal peripheral vascular disease, we will proceed to re-image.

RE:  S/p PFO closure using a 25 mm Cribiform Amplatzer device on 12/05/63

Dear Dr. Yancy: 

  It is a pleasure seeing Mrs. Xuereb in follow up s/p her PFO closure on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Cribriform Amplatzer device. 
Her history is also significant for inferior STEMI the morning after arthroscopic shoulder surgery for adhesive capsulitis in 10/63, Protein S deficiency, COPD, HTN and dyslipidemia. 
She is doing well from the cardiac perspective. She continues to note a rare, short-lived palpitation but states that these have definitely lessened in nature over the years. She does report, however, that she began to note non-exertional, short-lived episodes of chest pain which started about 1 month ago. She says that by the time she ""thinks about taking a SL NTG"", the pain has resolved. Her catheterization revealed non-significant CAD. Significant spasm in the ostium of the RCA. The distal RCA at the prior intervention site looks normal. 
She denies any further neurological events or headaches. 
Of note, she reveals that a few weeks prior to onset of chest pain she began smoking again. She was smoking 5 cigs/day, and has stopped since Saturday when she resumed her Chantix treatment plan. 
Our last recorded lipid profile drawn on 5/2/2064: CHOL: 135, HDL: 50. No TG or LDL noted. She has had this repeated since and is being followed by Dr. Yelton. We concur with LDL goal of &amp;lt;100.


	Past medical history:
   CAD-s/p IMI following shoulder surgery with evidence of acute thrombotic occlusion of her RCA; no other atherosclerotic lesions identified. ? paradoxical emboli. s/p thrombectomy with Export catheter - 10/04/2063 
PFO with large right to left shunting 
Protein S deficiency (? secondary to estrogen replacement) 
Adhesive capsulitis R shoulder; s/p arthroscopic surgical repair 10/3/2063 
May Thurner Syndrome- seen by Dr. Jones - no intervention needed

-Skin:   Warm, anicteric, without rashes. 


	EKG:
   NSR, 67bpm. 


	Assessment and plan:
   In summary, Xian is a 59-year-old female s/p myocardial infarction, likely the result of paradoxical emboli via a large PFO, and s/p closure of her PFO on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Cribriform Amplatzer device. She remains stable from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events. Given her new onset of chest pain, and recent return to smoking, we have asked her to stop smoking and call us in 2 weeks to report any change in her chest pain. If at that time, the pain has persisted we will obtain an ETT without imaging; if her pain has resolved with smoking cessation we will ask her to follow up with her PCP to continue with smoking cessation plan. We have asked that she have Dr. Paulette Yancy fax us a copy of her most recent lipid profile for our records and have reiterated the LDL goal of less than 100 for secondary prevention of strokes. We have asked her to obtain a TTE without bubbles for our annual review, and will call her once these results are available to us. We agree with continuation of her ASA therapy and will see her in follow up appointment in 1 year with another TTE without bubbles.

RE:  Urania Yerger

     MR #583-48-90-0

 

Dear Dr. Dillon:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today for the first

time in Titonka Care Center in follow-up of her

coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass grafting in

October of this year.  Though you know her history well, I will

recount it for the purposes of record keeping.  Ms. Yerger is

presently 81 years old.  Her vascular risk factors include

diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia.  She had no prior diagnosis

of coronary disease until she presented in early October with flash

pulmonary edema after which she ruled in for a small non-ST

elevation myocardial infarction.  Coronary angiography at the

Titonka revealed complex diffuse disease of the proximal LAD,

thrombotic lesion of the proximal circumflex with subsequent

complete occlusion and a complex lesion of the first large marginal

as well as a 70% osteal stenosis of a large PLV.  Angiography also

revealed a 90% left renal artery stenosis.  The patient underwent

subsequent successful stenting of her right renal artery followed

by coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Susan Abreu.  (SVG to

ramus, OM2, RCA, and LIMA to LAD).  Ms. Yerger's postoperative

course was notable for persistent pleural effusion and transient

episode of atrial fibrillation.  

 

Since her discharge, she has been slowly increasing her level of

activity experiencing mild dyspnea on exertion while on extending

shopping trips.  Overall, these symptoms have continued to improve. 

She denies orthopnea, PND, or shortness of breath at rest.  She has

had persistent mild ankle edema on the site of her saphenous vein

graft harvesting.  She denies palpitations, presyncope, TIA, CVA

symptoms or claudication.  

 

Detailed review of all other pertinent systems is negative.  Ms.

Yerger tells me that she has recently had an erythematous rash on

her upper and lower extremities that you have been managing as a

possible viral exanthem.  

Yerger, Urania

MR #583-48-90-0               -2-            December 14, 2078

 

Past medical history is notable for chronic renal insufficiency

(baseline creatinine 2), vascular risk factors as delineated and

prior right knee replacement.  

 

Her current medications include enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.

day, Lasix 40 mg po q. day, Glipizide 10 mg po q. day, Lisinopril

5 mg po q. day, Lopressor 25 mg po t.i.d., atorvastatin 10 mg po q.

day, Avandia, multivitamins, Protonix and Nystatin cream.

 

Social History:  The patient lives alone but has many family

members in the area.  She is currently staying with her daughter. 

At baseline, she has been able to ambulate slowly with a cane but

is limited by chronic knee pain.  She denies alcohol or tobacco

use.  Her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 60.

 

On physical exam, Ms. Yerger looks extremely well today.  She is

comfortable seated on the exam table.  Her skin is warm and dry. 

She has a diffuse erythematous macular papular rash predominantly

on her extremities.  Her blood pressure is 140/80, her heart rate

is in the 70's.  She has no jugular venous distention.  Her

carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Her chest reveals decreased breath

sounds at the left base.  There are no crackles or wheezes. 

Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and

rhythm, S1, S2 and S4 is present and P2 is slightly increased. 

There was a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur radiating toward the

apex.  Her abdomen is soft and nontender.  Her extremities are free

of cyanosis or clubbing.  Distal pulses are 1+.  She has mild edema

of the left lower extremity.

 

Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm 79 beats per minute, normal axis and

intervals, persistent deep anterior T wave inversions.

 

Overall, Ms. Yerger continues on a steady course of recovery after

her non-ST elevation MI and coronary artery bypass grafting in mid

October.  Her persistent dyspnea on exertion may be related to

persistent pleural effusion.  We will reevaluate today with a

repeat chest x-ray.  In the meantime, I think that we should

continue her oral diuretic regimen.  It is possible that her

persistent rash is related to her Lasix.  Although not certain to

be successful, we have made a change to Bumex 1 mg po q. day today

in the hopes that if Lasix is responsible for her rash this may

resolve.  I have made no other changes to her medical regimen.  We

will continue aspirin, beta blockade, ACE inhibition and statin for

secondary prevention.  I look forward to seeing her again in

approximately eight to twelve weeks.  In addition, she will follow-

up with Dr. Abreu for possible thoracentesis if she has a

persistent pleural effusion that may be contributing to her

symptoms.

not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

 

Sincerely yours,

Imaging:
Head CT: (my read) No hemorrhage, mass effect, or hypodensity/loss of grey-white junction.  No acute intracranial process.

Head MRI/MRA: pending


Impression: 58 year-old RHF w/ cardiovascular risk factor including HTN/DM/HL/obesity who presents with acute onset of R hand/arm weakness followed by headache/mild nausea.  Exam with R pronator drift/orbiting/hand clumsiness with distal>proximal arm weakness.  Slow motor initiation is characteristic of corticospinal tract lesion.  She has no face or leg weakness.

Sparing of face/leg suggests small embolic stroke to the corona radiata in L hemisphere where the motor fiber from face/arm/leg regions are most separated.  However, small capsular stroke is still a possibility.

Patient is outside the time window for acute stroke intervention.

Recommendations:
-Head and neck MRI/MRA
-If MRI shows a stroke, she will likely need to be admitted to RHR Neurology service for stroke workup including TTE, Holter, lipid panel, ESR, homocysteine, lipo(a), PT/OT.
-Change from ASA to Aggrenox for stroke prevention.
-Continue statin.
-Hold off on her BP med for 24 hours, but likely OK to resume after 24 hours if the stroke size is small.

Assessment and plan




Chest discomfort. The patient's history and exam do not suggest cardiovascular origin but pain originated in the chest wall, musculoskeletal in origin. She had an ECG in my office that was unchanged from previous ones, there were no ST-TW abnormalities, no extrasystoles or any other abnormality. She was reassured. For musculoskeletal pain I have recommended stretching exercises, and low dose diazepam for muscle contracture. She will avoid NSAID due to GI symptoms.

Abdominal discomfort with diarrhea. The patient will follow a CHO diet and will avoid dairy products and other substances with low-absorption high-residue. In addition, in context of weakness I have recommended her to have a chemistry analysis for investigating electrolytes. Should symptoms persist then I will recommend the patient to initiate Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole.

Dehydration. The patient will initiate a strict fluid replenishment plan for rehydration.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old female who returns to the clinic for a followup visit.  The patient has multiple medical problems including severe and extreme hypertension as well as high blood pressure and chronic renal failure for which she is currently attending dialysis sessions 3 times per week.  The patient also is currently being treated for hot flashes with Prempro.  The patient states that she ran out of her blood pressure medications including the patch 2 days ago.  She also complains of frequent popping and loss of hearing in her right ear.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A middle-aged female in no acute distress.  Blood pressure is 182/94, weight is 211 pounds, and pulse is 76.  Chest is clear bilaterally.  Heart, regular rate and rhythm, positive S1, S2.  Negative S3, S4, no murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Lower extremities, no edema, nontender.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Chronic renal failure, on dialysis.  The patient appears to be doing much better and has stabilized on her regular dialysis sessions.  She is still waiting for donor for a renal transplant.  She will follow up with nephrology as scheduled.  She is currently being immunized for her transplant and will receive her third hepatitis B shot as well as her second hepatitis A shot today.

2.  Right ear problem.  The patient has wax buildup in her right ear and I recommended that she use olive oil on a nightly basis to resolve the earwax.

3.  Diabetes mellitus.  Control is much better.  There is a recent hemoglobin A1c of 6.3.

4.  Severe hyperlipidemia, which has improved after the patient was started on dialysis.  Of note, was also a very high HDL.  The patient is currently on no hypolipemic medication.  We will check a fasting lipid profile at this point.

5.  Severe hypertension.  Prescriptions for nifedipine and the clonidine patch were refilled.

6.  Hyperparathyroidism.  We will check a PTH level today.

 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Riley is a 67-year-old woman who presents to Internal Medicine for followup.  Since her last visit, she has continued on her regimen of 70/30, 90 units in the morning and up to 90 units at dinnertime (sometimes 1/2 after dinner).  She also uses Lispro 25 units at lunch.  On this regimen, her morning blood sugars have ranged 
Pre-breakfast: 96-214, mostly 100-130.
Pre (sometimes post) Dinner: 128-307, mostly 140-160

The good news is her last A1c dropped to 7.2% from 8.3% (1 year ago was 10.4%)

She has known retinopathy and has had multiple laser treatments.  She goes routinely to the ophthalmologist, at least twice a year and several times a year to the podiatrist as well. She is otherwise in good health, though today she complains of depressed mood, for which she is in therapy. 

On ROS she denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, polyuria, polydipsia, fevers, chills, diarrhea, vaginal or urinary symptoms, numbness or tingling of her lower extremities.  She has not had any hypoglycemia.  She does not exercise.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post total thyroidectomy (because of large goiter) on levothyroxine 200 mcg daily. COPD, obesity, CHF (EF 40%), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, sleep apnea, status post cholecystectomy.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol inhaler, Ambien, atenolol 50 mg daily, clonidine 0.2 mg b.i.d., aspirin 81 mg daily, Flovent b.i.d., levothyroxine 200 mcg p.o. daily, lisinopril 20 mg daily, Nexium 40 mg daily, Singulair 10 mg p.o. daily and Lipitor 20 mg p.o. nightly, Metormin 1000 mg BID, Lasix 20 mg daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Ms. Riley is from Mexico.  She has lived here for the last 15 years and denies tobacco or alcohol.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well-appearing overweight woman.  Blood pressure 117/57, pulse 87, weight 210 down fr 212 last visit, fingersticks 247 postprandial, reports took lispro today.  Extremities, no edema, well perfused with palpable pulses.  No ulcerations or skin breakdown. Microfilament and vibratory sensation intact.  

PREVIOUS DATA:  Labs from 11/22/70: TSH 0.137.  Microalbumin was negative.  Cholesterol was 109, LDL 40, HDL 36, TG 163 A1c 7.2%, down from 8.3% on 7/31/2070 

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  In summary, Ms. Riley is a 67-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes for the last 20 years with poor glycemic control, but significant improvement recently, with latest hemoglobin A1c of 7.2%.

1.  Diabetes.  Her sugars are much improved, as is her A1c. We will switch her 70/30 regular to 70/30 Novolog, given that she gives herself the insulin just after the meals and that she is using Novolog for lunch as well. We emphasized again the pm dose should NOT be pre-bed but pre-dinner.  She will continue dose of 90 units QAM and Qdinner of 70/30 and Lispro 25U for lunch. She will continue on metformin 1000 mg twice daily. She will continue to follow up with Opthalmology and Podiatry.  Her blood pressure is in target range on clonidine and lisinopril.  Her LDL is also in target range on Lipitor.   She will continue on a baby aspirin. Her microalbumin is negative.   

2.  Hypothyroidism.  TSH somewhat suppressed, 0.137, will therefore reduce levothyroxine to 175 mcg QD

She will follow up in 3-4 month's time.

Name: Younger, T Eugene

MR#: 6381987

Att: Dr. Gilbert

Cards: Dr. Ullrich

Neuro: Dr. Donovan

Date of Admission: 7/2/88



CC: Lightheadedness, vertigo, and presyncopal sx x several episodes



HPI:. 64 yoM w/ significant PMH for CAD, HTN, GERD, and past cerebral embolism presents w/ 6 hour history of vertiginous symptoms, dizziness, lightheadedness, and feeling ""like [he] was going to pass out"".  The pt recalls waking and getting ready for work.  He then began having short episodes of vertiginous attacks in which he felt the room was ""constantly going out of focus"" and inability to ""lock in on any one thing"".  The pt had several episodes of these presyncopal attacks w/o LOC.  The pt had no associated CP or palpitations, however noted some increased rate of breathing.  The pt also noted some reflux sx a/w attacks.  He denies f/c, ns, d/c, diploplia/photophobia.  Had associated nausea without vomiting as well as tinnitus, which he usually has.  Attacks began to affect driving so he presented to EW.



Pt has one prior episode similar to this experience in 2082, for which he received imaging studies including CT of the head, MRI/MRA, TCDs which revealed no infarcts, but poor flow in the mid-basilar artery.  TTE at that time showed an intra-atrial septal aneurysm.

MRN: 63925217

CHIEF COMPLAINT.  Follow-up with regard to multiple medical problems.

SUBJECTIVE.  She begins with a very long reprise of her complaints about her 
hospitalization at Sawtelle Veterans Hospital earlier this fall.

She then follows with a long discussion of the difficulties in securing 
diabetic supplies.  Her home blood glucoses have been variable, reportedly 
due to poorly functioning glucose meter.

The Neurology Consultant has added lisinopril and Plavix to her regimen.

Had what appears to have been an injection of epidural steroids for treatment 
of symptoms referable to spinal stenosis per Dr. Jaeger, to good effect.  Her 
back pain has now begun to recrudesce, and she is considering another such 
injection.

There are multiple other somatic complaints -- neck pain; recurring nocturnal 
sweating; dry cough; runny nose; other.

MEDICATIONS.  Baby aspirin; supplements of calcium and vitamin D; Fosamax 
70 mg once weekly; prednisone 5 mg b.i.d.; folic acid 1 mg per day; 
methotrexate 15 mg per week; Celebrex 200 mg b.i.d.; Glucophage 500 mg 2 PO

NAME: Ocampo, Nathan-Oliver 
MRN: 80531359 
DOV: 05/28/90 


Mr. Ocampo comes in for follow up of his hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia and also wants to assess his impotence.  Mr. 
Ocampo gets only semi-erections.  He was quite depressed about this 
issue during March, but he feels that his mood has improved.  His 
daughter, Urbina, did talk to me in the hallway about concerns that her 
father might be depressed although he feels that this was a significant 
component of the issue.  He had not had chest pain, chest pressure or 
fainting spells.  He has had no nausea, diarrhea, vomiting or 
constipation.  Urinary symptoms are stable.  His neurological status is 
fine. He tried to lose 5 pounds by exercising and was successful.

EXAM:  On physical examination today his blood pressure is 130/74.  His 
HEENT exam is unremarkable.  His chest is clear.  His heart shows no 
murmurs.  His abdominal examination is benign.  His rectal is guaiac 
negative with a smooth prostate.  I gave him a pack of stool guaiac 
cards.  

ASSESSMENT:  I will give him a prescription of Viagra and I gave him 
appropriate patient education.  I will see him in six months.  I will 
get some laboratory tests and write him a letter.  We will be tuned 
into the issue of depression going forward.

Mr. Vieira presented to Dr. Atwood clinic 
today with persistent wound collection in the below knee popliteal incision. He noticed a lump approximately 3 weeks ago, underwent incision and drainage with wick placement and started a course of PO antibiotics. This has continued to drain serosanguinous fluid, apparently the overall induration and erythema with some additional fluid under moderate pressure was released. He has been seen daily by a visiting nurse and she can do the dressing, replacing the wick, and putting a sterile absorbent dressing on top of this. We will see him again in another week.
  He is on coumadin, last dose 3.5 last night.

EDVISIT^72484104^URQUHART, WENDELL^02/15/34^MARQUEZ, RONALD

I evaluated this patient independently.  I concur with findings

as noted on the medical record, supervised the care as provided

by the resident in the Emergency Department.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, this is a 61-year-old male

with complaint of chest discomfort on exertion for the past six

weeks after climbing upstairs.  The patient noticed symptoms

again today.  He called his FLH physician who sent him to the

Emergency Department for probable admission.  The patient has had

a prior history of proximal RCA lesion and two stents placed in

06/2128 after similar episodes.  The patient has been doing well

since and recently has developed worsening symptoms.  He is

followed by Dr. Ure and contacted Dr. Ure's office who

sent him to the Emergency Department.  He denies chest pain at

rest.  He does not have abdominal pain.  No pain radiating to the

back.  No shortness of breath, dysuria, or additional symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension and coronary artery disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  As noted, past surgical history is stent

placement.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past tobacco user.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for that which is noted on the

HPI.  All other symptoms are negative as noted in the medical

record.

MEDICATIONS:  Please refer to the chart.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs are as noted in the medical

record.  I examined this patient and agree with physical exam

findings as noted on the record.  Please refer to the chart.  Of

note, the patient has no specific physical exam findings, a

benign physical examination.

LABORATORY DATA:  Pending.  EKG is normal sinus rhythm with

biphasic T waves in III, V6 but otherwise normal, no acute ST-T

wave changes.  The patient is currently pain free.

ASSESSMENT AND MEDICAL DECISION MAKING:  This is a 61-year-old

male with likely stable angina that is worsening in character. 

He will be admitted to Cardiology.  I discussed this case with

the cardiologist on call, Dr. Maxwell.  The patient will be

admitted for further workup and determination of catheterization

if necessary.

OCHILTREE GENERAL HOSPITAL



History of present illness   This is a 54-year-old white male here complaining persistent cough.  He has had a dry cough for about two months.  He was put on inhalers, but there was no improvement.  The cough is worse at night, but also he has it during the day.  He has no mucus production, no hemoptysis, no shortness of breath, and no wheezing.  He is a nonsmoker.  About a week ago, he was admitted to a local emergency room for chest pain.  He was rushed to Ochiltree General because of ST-T wave abnormalities on his EKG.  In retrospect, he has had these changes for many years, and anyway he had a cardiac catheterization, which showed mild obstruction of some of his coronary systems but no evidence of coronary artery syndrome.  He did have cardiomyopathy with the ejection fraction of 35%.  He was sent home on Toprol XL 50 mg QD, Lipitor 10 mg QD, lisinopril 10 mg, aspirin 325 mg once a day, and Avandia 2 mg once a day.  Since returning home, the patient feels no chest pain or shortness of breath.  No orthopnea or PND.  He still has a dry cough.

			Assessment and plan:

   It looks like Mr. Quin has had an MI sometime in the past. Myocardial scans showed only mild ischemia in the territory of the prior MI.  Since he is asymptomatic, I would continue medical therapy.  For some reason, he has not started Lipitor.  His LDL is markedly elevated.  My target LDL would be below 70.  For his myocardial protection, I have suggested that he increase the dose of Toprol from 25 mg. qd to 50 mg. qd.

65 FERRY STREET

BARABOO, UT 11521





04/05/2073





Dear Mr. Louis, 





It was very nice to see you again the other day.  I hope you are doing well.  I am writing to let you know about your recent test results.  





The following tests were essentially negative, normal, or unchanged from prior testing and do not require follow-up at this time.

1) Kidney test.

2) Cholesterol.  Your cholesterol results are as follows:

     Total Cholesterol = 129,

     HDL (the 'good' cholesterol) = 43,

     LDL (the 'bad' cholesterol) = 70,

     triglycerides = 82.

My records indicate that your total cholesterol has increased since 01/11/2072.  Given your medical history, we would like to keep your LDL (the 'bad' cholesterol) below 100.  Please continue to follow a heart-healthy diet.

3) Hemoglobin A1c.  This is a blood test that indicates how well you have controlled your blood sugar over the past 3 months.  For patients with diabetes, we would like to keep it below 7.  Your Hemoglobin A1c value was 6.5 on 04/04/2073.  It has remained stable compared to the last value of 6.5 on 07/12/2072.  Please continue to check your sugars regularly and take Metformin as prescribed.

4) X-ray.  No fractures were detected on the X-ray of your spine, but it did show changes consistent with osteoarthritis.





The following tests were abnormal or require follow-up.

1) PSA.  As we discussed during our visit, this is a blood test that measures activity in your prostate, and is one way to measure your potential risk of prostate cancer.  This is not a perfect test, and its use for prostate cancer screening is controversial.  My records indicate that your PSA has mildly increased since 4/01/72.  I recommend that you follow-up with a urologist for a prostate biopsy, which we can arrange when you return for your follow-up appointment.  At that time, we will again discuss the specifics of the PSA test and the risks/benefits of different treatment/follow-up options.





If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach me at my office at 191-537-1871.  I will see you on 5/16/73 at 9:40am for our next appointment.

DO,TANYA V   639-25-21-7                    VISIT DATE: 11/10/04

The resident's history, physical examination, and evaluation were 

reviewed by me; and I concur.  In addition, I personally 

interviewed and examined this patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 76-year-old female with 

a history of type 2 diabetes on Glucophage with a history of 

neuropathy who presents complaining of right foot pain, swelling, 

and redness.  The patient had a callus shaved off the plantar 

aspect of her foot approximately three weeks ago.  She noticed some 

aching pain in the area of her foot over the last several days and 

then in the last 24 to 48 hours has developed swelling and redness 

of her foot with inability to ambulate secondary to severe pain.  

She has had loss of appetite, but she denies any fever or 

generalized malaise.  She denies any leg swelling.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for arthritis, type 2 diabetes, a 

history of vasculitis, history of diabetic neuropathy, and history 

of cataracts.  Her surgical history is positive for right total hip 

replacement, bilateral knee replacements, laminectomy in the back 

with fusion with rods, and a history of a colostomy with reversal.  

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  She has smoked in the past.  

She does not drink.  She is a retired Paralegal, lives alone.  She 

has a family history of diabetes.  Please see resident note for the 

remainder of the details of the patient's history including a long 

list of medications.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 99.0, pulse 94, 

respirations 18, blood pressure 137/50.  Oxygen saturation is 92% 

on room air.  The patient is an awake, alert, well-developed 

female, pleasant, talkative, in no acute distress.  EXTREMITIES: 

Her examination is most remarkable for the right lower extremity 

which shows edema and redness over the dorsum of her right foot.  

This extends down over the metatarsophalangeal joints and down 

underneath the plantar aspect of her foot over the heads of the 

metatarsals and the bases of the toes.  On the plantar aspect of 

the foot below the third toe, there is an area of skin change which 

is very tender.  There is a blanching yellow appearance that is 

very firm.  It is not fluctuant.  There is no drainage.  It appears 

to be the area where the callus was shaved.  The remainder of the 

foot is slightly firm, erythematous, and tender.  Her pulses are 

1+.  She has good capillary refill, and light touch is intact.  Her 

calf is soft and nontender.  Please see the resident note for the 

remainder of the details of the physical examination.  Evaluation 

of this patient in the Emergency Department included laboratory 

studies.  This is a diabetic patient with foot cellulitis secondary 

to a wound on the plantar aspect of her foot.  Of note, she also is 

exposed to pool water as she swims daily.  

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  She had laboratory studies performed which 

show a white blood cell count of 14,000; hematocrit 31.5; platelets 

348.  Her electrolytes including glucose are pending at the time of 

this dictation.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  IV access was obtained, and the 

patient was treated with IV antibiotics of Levaquin and 

Clindamycin.  

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Right foot cellulitis.

Vascular Surgery Admit H+P

Name:  Nathan Vieira
Medical Record:  #0666729
Date of Evaluation:  12/13/78
Attending:  Dr. Atwood

CC:  L leg/foot pain

History of Present Illness: Pt is a 71 yo M s/p bilateral fem-pop BPG   s by Dr. Atwood who had been previously asymptomatic walking up to five miles without claudication, after his R BPG in Feb and L BPG in April of this year.  He in fact saw Dr. Atwood on 11/10 and had a good DP pulse at that time on the left.  However, one week ago he sat on the floor for ~3 hours doing electrical work, flexed at the hip and slightly flexed at the knee, and that night he began to have calf and dorsal foot pain on the L side.  This lasted for ~24 hours.  He went to his PCP who was concerned that he may have compromised his graft given he had a diminished DP pulse on the L, and also had developed an area of erythema on the L lateral calf which the PCP suspected to be cellulitis.  He was prescribed keflex by his PCP which he started on 12/10, and the patient reports his erythema has improved since starting the abx.  He then revisited Dr. Atwood who found diminished trace DP pulse on the L, possibly secondary to graft kinking and/or thrombosis, and advised the patient to be admitted today for likely angiogram and possible thrombolysis in the AM.  On ROS he has had no F/C/N/V/D/abd pain/back pain.

CARDIOLOGY

KELLIHER CARE CENTER



Reason for visit:

   F/u of coronary disease and hypertension.   



Interval History:

   Ted continues to feel well. He has not taken nitroglycerine for 6 months. He exercises for 25 minutes 3 days per week on the treadmill and does not get chest pain. He does continue to gain weight because of dietary caloric indiscretion. He is not having any edema or orthopnea. 



Family history:

   Brother has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. 



Physical examination:

-General:   No acute distress.

-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.

-Heent:   Unremarkable

-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP no jugular venous distention.

-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.

-Cardiac:   Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 +S4. There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.

-Extremities:   No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ femoral pulses without bruits. 2+ pedal pulses.

-Neuro:   A&O x3, CN 2-12 grossly intact. 

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds, soft and has mild epigastric tenderness, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.

-BP: 127/55  

-Pulse: 43  

-weight: 185  lbs.

-BMI:   



EKG:

   Sinus rhythm, intraventricular conduction defect, poor RWave progression, unchanged from previous.





Impression:

   Ted continues to do well. I discussed with him the reason for his persistent positive stress test and the posterolateral redistribution being related to the circumflex occlusion. There is good collaterals to this territory and I told Ted he needs to continue to exercise to build up those collaterals. We will repeat a stress test on him next spring to make sure he has not had progression of disease in his other arteries.

NAME:    Wilson, Gabriel
MRN:       8514931

The patient is a 71-year-old woman who comes in for follow up. She has been having
symptoms of ataxia which are difficult to understand in the sense that I cannot get a
clear history of her symptoms. At times she reports that she feels dizzy as if she might
fall over to her right side. There is no associated vertigo, dysarthria or other
symptoms. She has not actually had syncope. There is no positional component to her
symptoms. I had scheduled her for an MRA/MRI to evaluate those symptoms. The
MRI does show some small microvascular changes in the coronal radiata, centrum
ovale and bilateral pontine region. She had small chronic lacunar infarcts. She reports
that she falls to the right, but the stroke seemed to be more on the right brain which
would not necessarily correlate with her symptoms. She had some left internal carotid
mild 30% proximal stenosis. Her vertebral arteries were patent with anti-grade flow.  

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Small lacunar infarcts. Most likely related to hypertension rather
than embolic disease. Her blood pressure has been very well controlled. In fact, today
on exam, her blood pressure was 100/60. She brought her medications with her and
has been taking atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d., Cozaar 50 mg 1 tab twice a day and
hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. q.d. She had not taken her medications today and
her blood pressure here when I repeated it was 110/70 in the right arm and 120/70 in
the left. Her neck is supple without JVD or bruits. Her lungs are clear without
wheezes, rales or rhonchi. Her cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, normal
S1, S2. 
       
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:   History of hypertension. Now with lower blood
pressure and some lightheadedness. We will d/c her atenolol. I would like her to get a
repeat blood pressure in one week. I discussed her MRI/MRA findings with her.
Long term we will need to continue to try and optimize her cholesterol levels and her
diabetes. She will follow up in one week for a repeat blood pressure.

Pt:	Jasso, Stephen

MR#: 	 7990698

Date of Admission:  7/05/95

Attending: 	I. Ellsworth



CC:  Vertigo, EKG changes



HPI:  73   yo with h/o of DM, CAD s/p anteroseptal MI (2091) and stent placement presents with 2 days of vertigo, most prominent upon wakening in the a.m.  He reports feeling as if he is spinning while the room is stable; this sensation is worsened by changes in position or head movement.  It diminishes only slightly as the day progresses.  He denies any numbness, weakness, tingling, changes in vision or memory.  He denies any recent URI.  He does report tinnitus which has been present intermittently for years as well as bilateral sensorineural hearing secondary to gunshot exposure.  No NV. The sensation of vertigo is superimposed upon one week of gradually progressive loss of balance, described as not knowing where to put his limbs in relation to space.  He also reports ~7 days of mild diarrhea in a.m only, attributable to eating sorbitol ice cream as well as continuing to take Metamucil for the same 7 day period.  Diarrhea has been fully resolved for 2 days PTA. He does report good PO fluid intake, ~8 bottles of H20 per day.  He monitors his sugars regularly and reports they have been running in the 110-140s. He denies any fevers, chills, sweats or sick contacts.  The patient does have ptosis on the L and reports that this has been present less than one month.  He has had no changes in medications.



Additionally, the patient reports one episode of fleeting chest pain along the midaxillary line on 07/12 which was relieved immediately by NTG.  (Pt attributes the pain to gas as the belching coincident with the NTG also seemed to relieve the pain).  He does also report an increase in SOB after walking up one flight of stairs which has arisen over the past few months.

Xan Dillon, M.D.

22 East Dunstable Road

Nouakchott, GA  95269



Dear Dr. Dillon:



I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today in Titonka Care Center in followup of her coronary artery disease (CABG in October 2078), hypertension, and heart failure.  Since increasing her Lasix dose approximately 12 months ago, she has had substantial improvement in her heart failure symptoms.  She continues to admit to fatigue and musculoskeletal pain as limiting her exertion, but no longer experiences significant dyspnea.  She denies orthopnea, PND, or ankle edema.



Her current medications are aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 60 mg p.o. q.d., glipizide 10 mg p.o. q.d., losartan 100 mg p.o. q.d., Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. q.d., simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d., Avandia, and multivitamins.



Her blood pressure today is 165/70 and her heart rate is in the low 60s.  She is comfortable seated on the exam table.  Her jugular venous pressure is approximately 8 cm with prominent V waves.  There are very rare crackles at the bases.  Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and rhythm, normal intensity S1 and S2.  P2 is increased.  There is a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur, loudest at the apex.  She has no edema of the extremities and they are warm to touch.



Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm with normal axis intervals.  There is nonspecific ST abnormality, unchanged from her tracing in August.



In summary, Ms. Yerger remains free of recurrent angina or heart failure symptoms.  She does have evident persistent elevated right cardiac pressures on exam that may be related to her underlying pulmonary disease.  In light of her systolic hypertension, we increased her Toprol to 150 mg p.o. q.d.  She will have her blood pressure checked in the coming week and call the result to me.



I look forward to seeing her again in approximately six months.  It remains a pleasure being involved in this delightful woman's care.



Sincerely yours,

EDVISIT^49535763^DOSS, RUATH^09/25/90^GILMORE, RACHEL

The patient was seen in conjunction with resident, Dr. Xiang. 

Resident's note was reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined

by me.  Please see the resident's note for details of the

patient's past medical, social, family history, review of

systems, and physical exam.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Tingling and numbness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old woman with a

history of stroke and seizure in 12/2089 and a longstanding

history of diabetes who presents today with a sharp thumbtack

poking sensation in her right hand at 9:30 a.m. while driving. 

It lasted 3-4 seconds and then completely resolved.  Thirty

minutes later, she noticed a similar sensation in her right hand

for a few seconds and then resolved completely, and then she

noticed it in her right foot and the toes.  She wiggles her toes

in her shoe and then that resolved after a few seconds and then

30 minutes after that she had a similar but less severe sensation

in the fingertips of her left hand at about 10:45 that then

resolved completely.  Since then, she has had no sensation like

this.  She has had pins and needles feeling in her hands and feet

in the past, but never a sharp thumbtack feeling like this in the

past.  She had no dysarthria, confusion, weakness, numbness

trauma, dizziness, loss of consciousness, syncope, seizure

activity, changes in her medications, or any new medications. 

She took her Plavix as usual this morning, is now symptom free,

and very well appearing.  She called her doctor's office and the

nurse told her to come to the Emergency Department to be checked.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol,

seizures in the setting of a stroke in 12/2089, and a left MCA

stroke in 12/2089.  She has had no seizures since then.  She has

residual right lower extremity weakness, which is now much

improved.  Echo in 12/2089 showed an EF of 60%.  She has

concentric LVH, no wall motion abnormalities, and no other

surgeries.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past smoker of 30 pack years, ETOH none, and no

IV drug use.  She works as a Business Services Manager and lives

with her family.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.

MEDICATIONS:  She takes Dilantin, glipizide, Glucophage, Plavix,

atenolol, Cozaar, and Lipitor.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile with normal and stable

vital signs.  Awake, alert, and in no distress.  Her exam is

completely unremarkable including 5/5 strength in her upper and

lower extremities.  Gait is normal.  She has no cerebellar signs,

past pointing dysmetria, aphasia, ataxia, focal weakness, or any

focal sensory deficit at all.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG shows bradycardia at 50 beats a minute with

nonspecific T-wave changes.  Fingerstick is 150.  Dilantin level

is normal.  Head CT shows no evidence of bleeding or any other

abnormality.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Neurology was consulted and agrees

with the diagnosis of likely peripheral neuropathy.  They will

help arrange followup within 1 week for this patient with her

neurologist and she is told to see her primary care physician

within 2 weeks and to return to the Emergency Department for any

chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other worsening of her

symptoms.

DISPOSITION:  She is well appearing at the time of discharge in

satisfactory condition.

Major Problems





Coronary artery disease

Cardiac arrest while skiing January 2072; cath showed 70% distal left main, 90% proximal LAD, 90% first diagonal, 60% left circumflex, 40% first marginal, RCA normal.  Underwent 3-vessel bypass (SVGs to the LAD, diagonal, OM).  Last ETG January 2076 showed an equivocal mild apical reversible defect.  Remains asymptomatic.  Cardiovascular exam stable.  Update ECG.  He continues to see Dr.  Middleton periodically.



Diabetes mellitus

Metformin 1000 mg BID.  Added low-dose glyburide 1.25 mg QD in October, for hemoglobin A1c 7.80.  Followup hemoglobin A1c last month better, 7.10.  Asked him to concentrate more on diet.  Says he is up-to-date with Ophthalmology.     05/25/2077:   He remains asymptomatic.  Check A1c and urine albumin/creatinine ratio today.



Hyperlipidemia

Lipitor 10 mg QD.  Tolerating well.  Check followup lipids, CK, and transaminases.  Target LDL 70.02/27/2077:  Recent lipid profile excellent with LDL 72, HDL 70, triglycerides 46, and total cholesterol 151.  Serum CPK, June 2076, SGOT 74, and SGPT 41.  Review of prior test results discloses chronic low-grade elevation serum CK. Spoke with the patient; no myalgias, arthralgias, or fevers. Possibly related to Lipitor.  Discontinue, substitute pravastatin.  Return in four weeks to recheck CK and transaminases.  The patient understands.  Call in the meantime for problems or questions.     05/25/2077:   Now on pravastatin without side effects.  CK unchanged.  Continue to follow.



Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Documented on barium swallow 2069.  PPI therapy has been recommended, but  has not been very compliant.  Given another prescription today.02/23/2077:   Complains that omeprazole gives him diarrhea.  Change to Protonix 40 mg QD.     05/25/2077:   Doing well on Protonix without symptoms.

   This is a 56 year old female veterinarian who works for Calista Corporation in Wrightwood, AL who has been complaining of right shoulder pain for some time and was admitted to the GCC yesterday for same day arthroscopic surgery to treat adhesive capsulitis of the right shoulder.  The surgery went well without complications, but the patient awoke at home today with 3/10 chest pain and diaphoresis.  She called 911 and was found with inferior ST elevation and 8/10 CP that continued to worsen to 10/10 chest pain in the West Memorial Infirmary ER.  The ECG began to evolve reciprical changes, but the RV leads were negative for infarction.  The patient was transferred emergently directly to the GCC catheterization lab.

Re:   Neil Robison  #371-97-98



Dear Wilcox,



     I saw Mr. Robison today. I hadn't seen him since last year.  I'm very pleased to see how well he's done.  He has had no double vision, no staggering, and no numbness around the mouth.  His speech is a little slurred he says (unchanged).  He walks with a wide-based gait, but is otherwise steady on his feet.  There is no tremor.  His arms and legs are strong.  Extraocular movements are full.  The pupils are equal.  There is no ptosis.  His speech is fluent.



     He takes one aspirin a day as well Lipitor and some vitamins (the other medicines he doesn't recall but I think you are in the know about).  



     His blood pressure is 120/80.  The pulse is around 76.  There are no cervical bruits.  



     From my perspective he is doing well on the aspirin and we should sit tight.  I would like to see him again in a year and at that time we should have our Dopplers again to recheck the flow in the basilar artery. The right vertebral is dominant and the left is occluded.  The left MCA stem was hard to visualize on the imaging.  It may well be occluded with collateralization. The left imaging was in 2082.  He is stable at this time.  He knows to call if he develops any symptoms.



Best regards,





G. Kevin Yawn, M.D.

Dear Dr. Pagan:



Your patient Lauren Ferrara came into the office today for a follow-up visit.  As you know, she has a long and complex history of peripheral vascular disease with bilateral lower extremity bypass grafts.  Her left lower extremity bypass graft had occluded once previously, but was successfully restored by Dr. Tejeda.  In 02/61, we had detected a high-grade stenosis in the distal aspect of this graft by surveillance, and she underwent revision with a local patch angioplasty.  A subsequent ultrasound study done in 04/61 showed a widely patent graft and she has remained entirely asymptomatic.  She is not particularly active.  She denies any rest pain in the feet or significant claudication symptoms.  Recently, however, her husband had noticed some cyanosis of her left toes.  She remains on low dose aspirin in addition to Lipitor and her other medications.  She is a nonsmoker.



On examination today, she appeared well and in good spirits.  Blood pressure was measured at 130/60 in the right arm.  Lower extremity pulses are 2+ at the femoral level bilaterally.  On the right, there is a strong, easily appreciated pulse over her popliteal to dorsalis pedis bypass graft, and the foot is warm and well perfused.  On the left, I could not appreciate a pulse over her bypass graft incisions.  The left foot is slightly cooler than the right, and there are some mild cyanotic changes on the first toe in particular.  There are no frank or impending ulcerations or areas of irreversible ischemia.  There is a strong Doppler signal obtained over the posterior tibial artery at the ankle with an occlusion pressure of approximately 100 mmHg.  This yields an ankle index of nearly 0.7 and maybe falsely elevated.  A follow-up ultrasound study was performed in the vascular laboratory today.  The right lower extremity bypass remains widely patent.  As suspected, the left lower extremity bypass has now demonstrated to be occluded.



Ms. Ferrara left lower extremity bypass graft has occluded sometime during the last several months and her collateralization is clearly more marginal.  At the present time, she does not have any clear-cut symptoms of critical limb ischemia, though the slight discoloration of her toes is a clear sign.  The previous history of this graft including a prior thrombosis requiring thrombectomy and multiple revisions would not board well for any attempted thrombolysis or repeated rescue of this particular conduit.  Conversely, she has already had all of her lower extremity veins used for bypass operations and any redo bypass would be technically complicated.  I will need to review her previous angiograms from earlier this year to determine the status of her runoff and what the alternatives might be.  At the present time, however, she appears to have marginal, though reasonable collateralization and is essentially asymptomatic.  I think it would be reasonable to increase her antithrombotic therapy and I added a daily dose of Plavix to supplement a baby aspirin.  I spent sometime discussing the signs of worsening ischemia including more diffuse cyanotic skin changes of the toes, rest pain, or ulceration.  At a minimum, I will see her back in two months for reexamination, but I strongly encouraged the patient and her husband to contact us soon if there are any symptoms that suggest worsening of her circulation.  If her collateralization can remain stable, it certainly would be preferable to avoid having to consider a complex redo bypass with very limited remaining vein in this patient.



Thank you again for allowing us to participate in her care.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further assistance.



Sincerely,

HPI:  The patient is a 43 year old man with multiple medical problems 
who presents for routine follow up.
 
CURRENT ISSUES:
1.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.  The patient had a hemoglobin A1C 
     approximately a month and a half ago, which was 9.5.  We discussed 
     this in the office today, with the general concept that someone who 
     is taking three injections of insulin a day should have much 
     tighter control.  He states he has been following his finger 
     sticks, though admits that occasionally forgets to do this. His 
     current regimen is 35 units of NPH in the morning with 20 units of 
     regular.  At bedtime, he is taking 35 units of NPH and 6 units of 
     regular at dinnertime.  He denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.
2.   Hypercholesterolemia.  Of note, the patient recently experienced a 
     rash to his simvastatin.  This resolved on the discontinuation of 
     the simvastatin.  Of note, his most recent cholesterol was 314 in 
     January, 2067.  He has met with the dietician to discuss the 
     institution of a low-fat diet, and states that he tries to avoid 
     fats.
3.   Venous insufficiency secondary to deep venous thrombosis.  The 
     patient states he is doing better since the institution of a 
     Jobst stocking.  He still notes significant edema when he doesn't 
     wear this, but notes an improvement in ambulation when he is 
     compliant with the stocking.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure:  130/90.  Heart rate:  76.  
Respiratory rate:  12 and unlabored.  Cardiac exam:  Regular rate and 
rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs.  Lungs are clear to auscultation.  
Abdomen:  Soft, non-tender, obese, with active bowel sounds.  
Extremities show no clubbing or cyanosis.  There is 1+ pedal edema of 
the right lower extremity, which is covered with a Jobst stocking.  Foot 
care remains excellent.
 
IMPRESSION:                         
1.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.  We will increase the patient's 
     morning NPH dose to 40 units.  He will once again try to become 
     more compliant with his diet.  He will be scheduled for a follow up 
     ophthalmologic examination.
2.   Hypercholesterolemia.  We will hold off re-starting therapy given 
     his recent rash to simvastin.  We will re-check a fasting lipid 
     profile as well as a set of LFT's.

3.   General health maintenance.  We will once again schedule a follow 
     up examination with the dietician as well as the ophthalmologist.  
     He will keep a log of his sugars and follow up with me in the 
     clinic in approximately one to two months.

She thinks this is helping with the fluid but still has increased SOB at rest since yesterday afternoon. She can't remember what her PE felt like but says that this is more like fluid overload. She has a mild nonproductive cough and no hemoptysis. No fevers or sick contacts. She had SSCP today at noon that was gone in the ED but she says returned while on the floor, with no radition, no n/v/diaphoresis, no palpitations.  She said she can normally walk with a walker ~ 100 ft, but could not get up yesterday or today d/t pain.  


She has a history of multiple COPD and CHF exacerbations that have led to hospitalization.

Imaging:
PE-Protocol CT Scan CHEST/legs , Impression and Critical Findings:      1.No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism.  Linear filling defect in      the apical segmental artery of the left upper lobe could represent      chronic embolus.     2.Suboptimal opacification of the femoral veins.  Evaluation of DVT      is suboptimal.  Ultrasound of the lower extremities for deep      indicated to rule out DVT clinically indicated.     3.Evaluation of pulmonary parenchyma somewhat limited respiratory      motion.  There is bilateral subsegmental atelectasis.  The patient      has undergone prior lower lobe wedge resection.
  4. There are multiple mediastinal and hilar      lymph nodes, which are some centimeters in size.  They are slightly      more prominent than in the previous exam.  The right hilar lymph node      now measures 0.9 cm in short axis. The visualized thyroid gland      appears normal.  There are atherosclerotic vascular calcifications of      the coronary arteries.

5.      Legs: There is suboptimal opacification of the femoral veins limiting evaluation for deep venous thrombosis.  Doppler ultrasound would be      indicated to look for DVT. Significant bilateral degenerative changes      of the hips are seen.

****************************************************


Assessment:

 64F with h/o NSCLC, COPD, CHF who presents with 36 hours of increasing SOB and a feeling that ""the fluid is coming back.""  Has been on increasing doses on furosemide this week which has improved edema per patient but breathing is still worse today.  No other major symptoms.  



Plan:





#
 SOB
Patient presents with increasing SOB in the context of increasing ankle size and sense that she is hypervolemic.  Increased lasix has improved her fluid status but did not fully resolve her respiratory issue, which is worse today than yesterday. Differential includes CHF with fluid overload, PE, malignancy with obstructive component, PNA, or COPD exacerbation with viral infection. Increasing pulmonary hypertension a concern (h/o hypoventilation syndrome, RVH on echo, worsening dyspnea).
-Large acute PE ruled out with CT
-? of whether mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes have increased in size since previous, no other obvious progression of NSCLC, CT findings would not account for her dyspnea
-CXR and CT negative for acute PNA
-CXR and CT show mild atalectasis, possible interstitial fluid, but show no effusions or other significant signs of fluid overload.  BNP is not very high.  However, patient has poor PFTs and small change in volume status may tip her into respiratory distress.  Cough c/w increased volume or viral infection
-Plan is to continue with diuresis as volume overload is most likely explanation of her respiratory status, furosemide 80 mg BID with PRN lasix as needed to maintain fluid status -500-1.0 L tomorrow.  Avoiding more aggressive diuresis as she has a history of over-diuesis with ARF.


-Continue home Tiotropium, Albuterol, Fluticasone Prop/Salmeterol 500/50 (Advair Diskus 500/50) 


#
 NSCLC
Likely not the cause of tonight's presentation with acute SOB, although chest CT must be re-evaluated for possible evidence of cancer.  Mild or no increased size of mediastinal lymph nodes may be concerning.  
-F/U with Dr. Lacey in AM, patient wants all information regarding imaging results and prognosis directly from Dr. Lacey
-Appt already scheduled for July 13th with Dr. Lacey for f/u


#Anxiety/Depression
Patient prescribed clonazepam 0.25 BID but is taking it 0.25 in AM, 0.25 in PM, and additional 0.5 QHS for significant anxiety.  Additionally takes seroquel, pregabalin, fluoxetine.  Patient is very anxious on exam with intermittent crying, fearful expression.
-Continue on home regimen Seroquel, pregabalin, fluoxetine
-Clonazepam  0.25 QAM, 0.5 mg QHS, 0.25 daily PRN while in house


#Cardiac: Continue with home meds, will diurese as above for possible CHF exacerbation
 -Continue ASA, metoprolol, furosemide, simvastatin  


#DM
Home regimen is 70/30 50 units BID and Levemir 40-50 units QHS, titrated to sugars. Lowered totalo dose of insulin to 100 (70% of home dose), distibuted between basal and mealtime insulin, with additional sliding scale
-Continue to up-titrate insulin 


#Chronic Back Pain
-Continue percocet and lidocaine patches PRN.


Other Chronic issues (GERD, endometriasl hyperplasia, skin care)
-Continue meds as described in medication section



#Care Providers: Dr. Lacey (Surg Onc), Dr. Arthur Qin (PCP), Daughter Xiang 045-200-7477


#
 Presumed Full Code: Code needs to be discussed with patient in the morning; due to patient's significant anxiety, the discussion was not appropriate at this time. Patient said she was too anxious to discuss her medical problems or possible treatment.


#Dispo: Pending.  Patient lives at home but has been in rehab previously.  Daughter is Xiang, 045-200-7477, who lives with and takes care of her mother.

I agree w/ the excellent medical student note above so refer to it for past medical history, family history, social history, allergies, medications on admission, and labs. 





DIAGNOSIS: Shortness of Breath





HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS



64 YOF w/ a PMHx of NSCLC s/p LLL resection (was a T1N0Mx adenocarcinoma resected 10/2121 at Falls Clinic followed by Dr. Quentin Lacey from thoracic surgery), diastolic CHF - normal TTE (LVEF 76%, No WMAs), DM II - last A1c 5.1 on 2/13, DVT (L.proximal femoral vein) /PE - 4/22 off coumadin, COPD &#8211; on 2-2.5L home O2 w/ over 60 pk yr smoking history, morbid obesity w/ obesity hypoventilation syndrome that presents w/ shortness of breath for the past 1-2 days and SSCP prior to admission. Mild cough, non-productive but denies fevers/chills. Has been taking 80 mg BID lasix without much improvement but did notice increase in urination. 




PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 


VITALS: 
 98.3, 95, 128/74, 22, 92% 3 L NC

General - Elderly, obese, anxious female 
HEENT &#8211; PERRL, EOMI; sclerae anicteric, no conjunctival injection; oropharynx pink and moist 
Neck - JVP difficult to assess given the extra neck tissue

Pulmonary &#8211; No crackles or wheezes appreciated but pt had poor effort 
Cardiac &#8211; regular rate and rhythm but sounds were difficult to hear 

Abdomen &#8211; soft, non-distended; non-tender without rebound and guarding; normal bowel sounds; no masses or hepatosplenomegaly


Extremity &#8211; warm and well-perfused; 3+ LE edema

Neurology &#8211; good strength bilaterally, normal sensation bilaterally

Skin &#8211; no concerning lesions


Mental status &#8211; alert and oriented but anxious




BNP 423, CE negative x 1, K 2.9, CO2 34.6, BUN/Cr 11/.73, Glucose 141, Calcium 7.9 L, Mag 1.3 L 

H/H 10.5/32.8 MCV 85, TSH on 5/28/2123 5.01

EKG: Intermittent PACs but sinus, unchanged



CHEST CT: 

No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism.  Linear filling defect in the apical segmental artery of the left upper lobe could represent chronic embolus. S/P LLL resection.

Note: There are multiple mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, which are some centimeters in size.  They are slightly more prominent than in the previous exam.  The right hilar lymph node now measures 0.9 cm (1.5 cm upon wet read) in short axis. 





IMPRESSION AND PLAN


64 YOF w/ a PMHx of NSCLC

, diastolic CHF, remote PE that presents w/ shortness of breath for the past 1-2 days and SSCP prior to admission. Mild cough, non-productive but denies fevers/chills. Of note, PFTs showed obstructive defect FEV1/FVC 65% w/ FEV1 44% w/ low DLCO/VA 53% concerning for severe COPD w/ loss of alveolocapillary units but DLCO seems



# SHORTNESS OF BREATH. Multifactorial.
-Concern for worsening pulmonary HTN.  
Note there was a large PA, RVSP unable to be determined on ECHO but RVH w/ mulitple etiologies that could contribute to pulmonary HTN (chronic PEs, L sided CHF). Needs pulmonary HTN w/u w/ RHC. Will contact Dr. Quant.
-

NSCLC. Pt had a T1N0Mx adenocarcinoma resected 10/2121 and followed by Dr. Quentin Lacey from thoracic surgery. Chest CT appears stable from 3/27/2123 but will have him review given the one LN is .9-1.5 cm - will ask if it is amenable to biopsy.
-Diastolic CHF - normal TTE (LVEF 76%, No WMAs.) w/ 2-3+ pitting edema. BNP 423. Diurese until Cr increases. Goal TBB -1L. Will f/u on lasix 80 mg PO BID. 

-Morbid obesity w/ obesity hypoventilation syndrome continue on BiPAP

-Hx of PE. Will f/u w/ radiology re: chronic nature of PE 

-COPD &#8211; on 2-2.5L home O2. Diffuse emphysema. Standing nebs. VBG before BiPAP



# DM II - last A1c 5.1 on 2/13. Switch to Lantus/Aspart while in hospital b/c we do not have 70/30.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM. 
Will try and determine why pt was increased to 175 mcg Levothyroxine w/ TSH of 5 in May 2123. 




Appreciate the excellent care of her resident PCP and will e-mail Dr. Arthur Qin that she is in the hospital. Rest as above.

VUONG,XOCHILT R   515-31-23-5                  VISIT DATE: 01/15/61
PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Bleeding. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 71 year old female status 
post cardiac cath stent placement and then later EP study states 
that she was doing well until last night when she started to ooze 
from the groin site.  She did not apply any pressure.  She states 
that she was bleeding through the night, did not want to bother her 
brother, called Dr. Aponte today who told her to come in.  She 
states that she did not know where the site was.  She could not see 
it and she did not apply pressure.  She has no chest pain, no 
shortness of breath.  She is not dizzy.  She is on Lovenox and 
Coumadin both.  She has not had her PT checked.  The rest of the 
systems were reviewed and are negative. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Depression, cardiac cath, hypothyroidism. 
MEDICATIONS:  Taken from the chart. 
ALLERGIES:  Taken from the chart. 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her brother. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her heart rate was 81, her temperature is 
96.5 degrees, blood pressure is 123/64.  This is a well-developed 
female, alert, oriented.  HEENT exam is atraumatic, normocephalic. 
Neck is soft and supple.  Mouth and throat are normal. 
Well-hydrated moist mucosa.  Conjunctiva are clear.  Sclerae are 
non-icteric.  There is no jugular venous distention.  Heart had a 
regular rate and rhythm.  The lungs were clear to auscultation 
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender.  No guarding.  No 
hepatosplenomegaly.  There is a hematoma at the right groin.  The 
cath site was about 1 cm and closed but there was some small oozing 
from the site.  It stopped with pressure.  The patient was covered 
in blood and blood clots.  The old dressing was removed.  All the 
dried blood and blood clots were removed.  The patient was cleaned 
up by myself.  Then, the nurses put her in the hospital gown. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  PT, PTT, CBC were obtained. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  After speaking with the patient at 
length, it seems that she lives with her older brother.  She is 
caring for him and is a bit overwhelmed with this.  Obviously, her 
medical knowledge base is not adequately prepared to deal with this 
problem.  She will be admitted to the Observation Area through the 
day for nurse training.  Social Services will be consulted to 
arrange for a home visiting nurse.  Dr. Aponte was called. 
CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Social Services and Dr. Aponte. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Bleeding from cath site and knowledge deficit. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  See the chart 
for disposition.

DIFFERENTIAL REQUEST   RECEIVED



Imaging: CT/CTA: old right parietal infarction; occluded right internal carotid artery; thrombus in right middle cerebral artery.



EKG: NSR, 68, LAD, no ST/T changes.



Impression: 49 year-old right-handed man presenting with right MCA-distribution stroke. He has a prior right parietal stroke apparent by CT scan and an occluded right internal carotid artery. Artery-to-artery embolus from the right ICA to the right MCA represents a likely etiology for stroke in this patient.



Recommendations:

1.	Admit to CMF neurology

2.	MRI with diffusion to assess distribution of stroke and whether diffusion/perfusion mismatch is present.

3.	allow blood pressure to autoregulate, with approximate SBP goal 140-180. When scanning done, pt should be extubated and exam followed, correlated with blood pressure.

4.	consider heparin if territory of infarct is not so large as to render hemorrhage into infarction too great a risk.

Surgery has debrided the wound, sending wound cultures as well as blood cultures. Acute OM would not be visible on XR changes and clinical picture is more consistent with acute than Chronic OM. Will consider further work up for OM if symptoms do not respond to treatment. Levo and flagyl were added to unasyn in accord to previous culture data.

2.	PVD: Will need arterial LENIS to assess for vascular patency and flow. Continuing ACEI, and adding ASA and lipitor, will order lipid profile and smoking cessation consult.

3.	DM2: Very poor control last admission, eventhough patient now says he takes medications and checks it up to QID. Will order HgbA1C and glucose monitoring.

HARDY,TERESA   360-52-41-3                    VISIT DATE: 12/03/75

This patient was seen concurrently with Dr. Jeter, whose note I 

have reviewed and with which I agree. 

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 56-year-old female who 

presents with complaints of chest pain.  The patient has a known 

history of coronary artery disease and most recently had a stent 

placed in April of 2075.  The patient had an episode of chest 

tightness with dyspnea while walking to catch a bus.  The patient 

states that this is unusual for her.  She does not usually have 

discomfort with exertion since having her stent placed.  That did 

resolve with rest and now the patient states she had a just ""trace"" 

of chest tightness throughout the day otherwise.  The patient came 

to Abbeville General Hospital and while walking uphill towards 

the hospital entrance she had recurrence of her discomfort.  The 

patient is pain-free on arrival to the emergency department.   

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per the written note. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 

angioplasty, stent, coronary artery disease, pulmonary 

hypertension. 

MEDICATIONS:  Glyburide, aspirin, Lasix, and otherwise as per the 

written note.

ALLERGIES:  Actifed.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished 

female in no acute distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.9, pulse 

87, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 161/93.  Oxygen saturation 

is 98% on room air.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are 

equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular 

motions are intact.  LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No 

crackles.  No wheezes.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  

Physical exam is otherwise as per the written note.  

LABORATORY EVALUATION: Labs are significant for an EKG which shows 

a sinus rhythm at 87 beats per minute.  There are 1-mm ST 

depressions in leads V5 and V6.  This was compared to a prior EKG 

from July 2075 and was found to be without significant change.  The 

only new change on the EKG is that a previously biphasic T-wave in 

V4 is now upright.  Glucose is 215, BUN 21, creatinine 1.1, sodium 

140, potassium 3.9, chloride 100, bicarb 32, CK 321, MB 3.1, trauma 

0.07, calcium 9.4, white count 8.8, hematocrit 40.1, platelets 247, 

PT 11.3, PTT 25.0.  Urinalysis shows no blood, no leukocyte 

esterase, no nitrates.  Chest x-ray shows no infiltrate, no 

pulmonary edema.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen and evaluated 

in the emergency department with labs and studies obtained as 

documented above.  The patient's history is concerning for angina.  

The patient received an aspirin, as well as Lopressor, while in the 

emergency department.  She has remained pain-free throughout her 

period of observation while in the emergency department.  The 

patient will require serial cardiac enzymes due to her most recent 

chest discomfort being en route to the hospital and if these are 

unremarkable the patient will require a functional cardiac study 

such as an exercise tolerance test. 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Angina.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 

admitted to the hospital in satisfactory condition.

RE:  Vicente, Kadeem F.
     MRN: 948-59-58-0
 
Dear Miles:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Vicente in Cardiovascular Care today.  This lovely 77-year old man has had past medical
history notable for coronary artery disease, hypertension, benign
prostatic hypertrophy, depression, insomnia, osteoarthritis status
post total knee replacement.
 
He presents today because of a recent exacerbation of symptomatic
coronary artery disease.  His history of coronary artery disease
begins with his presentation following his total knee replacement
in June of 2091.  In 10/91 he had an episode of profound weakness
and sat down.  He had no clear substernal chest pressure, loss of
consciousness or edema.  Workup at that time included a thallium
test which did not clearly demonstrate ischemia and an
echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 50%.  He began therapy
at that point in time with aspirin, niacin, vitamin E, Lasix,
Zestril, Zantac, Minipress, Amitriptyline, and Digoxin.  He had
been free of exertional neck, chest, arm and jaw pain, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, claudication and TIA
until this past spring.  He actually had done very well with risk
factor reduction including completing cardiac rehab at MJH and
following a stringent weight reduction program and decreasing his
weight.  In March of 2094 he began noticing that when he was going
up the 19 steps in his house he began having mid-sternal chest
discomfort and some dyspnea at the top of the stairs.  He stopped
working with the physiotherapist at that point and was initiated on
nitrate therapy.  Since that time he has noted that he has had
significant decrease in symptoms and over the past week has
actually had no need to take sublingual nitroglycerine and has been
taking the full flight of stairs without difficulty.  He does note
fatigue and insomnia such that he is sleeping only 2 to 3 hours a
night.  He does continue to be free of paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations or lightheadedness.
 
Medical regimen includes Ambien, Paxil, Isordil 20 t.i.d.,
Atenolol, Digoxin, Zantac and aspirin.  He has no known drug
allergies.
 
On physical exam blood pressure when he first arrived at Clinic was
noted to be 220/100.  At the present time it is 180/100 with a

heart rate of 55 and a respiratory rate of 10.  There is no
increase in jugular venous pressure.  His carotids are free of
bruits.  His lungs are entirely clear to auscultation throughout,
and cardiac exam is notable for a non-displaced PMI, S1 and
physiologically-split S2 with no murmur, rub or gallop.  Abdominal
exam is notable for a ventral hernia.  There is no organomegaly and
neither are there bruits present.  Lower extremities are notable
for 2+ femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial
pulses with no edema.  Skin exam is notable only for the senile
angioma.
 
Electrocardiogram is notable for a left bundle branch block which
is new since prior tracing available here of 4/03/94.  MIBI was
notable only for a potential fixed anteroseptal defect and no
significant ischemia on 5/6/94.  The ejection fraction on a gated
spect was 57%.  
 
In summary, it appears that Mr. Vicente may have experienced a new
myocardial infarction resulting in a left bundle branch block in
March of 2094.  He could, however, also have developed his
progressive conduction system disease and have the fixed defect on
his MIBI attributable only to a left bundle branch block.  I will
be reviewing the primary images to make my final decision.  In
either regard he is now free of symptoms on his current medical
regimen despite his increased weight and his increased blood
pressure.  I certainly agree with further assistance from nutrition
and weight loss and proceeding with Imdur therapy which I would
increase to 60 mg p.o. q.d.  I also would consider further decrease
of his LDL with statin therapy but would only consider this after
assessing his response to re-initiation his nutrition program. 
Given his lack of symptoms at the present time with his usual daily
activity, I would prefer to proceed on the medical therapy route. 
I think that he could be reintroduced to rehab at MJH with the
hopes that further education can get him back on line in terms of
risk factor reduction.  
 
I certainly look forward to discussing this case further with you. 
It's certainly a pleasure to participate in his care.
 
Sincerely,

VICENTE,KADEEM FRANCIS   948-59-58-0              VISIT DATE: 09/30/95

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Chest discomfort. 

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 78-year-old gentleman 

who had a stuttering course of chest discomfort throughout the 

night, last night, and into today.  He finally took nitroglycerin 

tablets at about 9 or 10:00 a.m. and this abated his chest 

discomfort.  The patient has known history of coronary artery 

disease and recently had gone back on his coronary rehab program, 

however, yesterday after a workout, he became extremely tired, more 

tire than usual.  He thought he might have pushed it a bit and he 

rested throughout the rest of the day.  Then last night, he had 

some chest discomfort, which he initially did not think much of. 

Then was then associated with some shortness of breath in the early 

morning hours.  He felt he was wheezing.  This resolved after he 

got up and walked around.  He took the nitroglycerin tablets this 

morning.  These were fresh nitroglycerin tablets he had just 

obtained and this, in fact, resolved his symptoms.  He then came in 

to see Dr. Echeverria, his physician, in clinic and was sent to the 

emergency department for evaluation.  Please see the handwritten 

emergency department record for additional details. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease 

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  See handwritten emergency 

department record. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is presently comfortable, not 

tachypneic.  His blood pressure is 160/80.  His heart rate is in 

the 50s.  There is no evidence of congestive heart failure on 

examination.  There is no jugular venous distention and his lungs 

are clear to auscultation.  His heart examination is distant, with 

no murmurs or gallops appreciated.  His extremities have trace 

edema.  Abdomen in soft and non-tender.  Pulses are equal. 

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  His electrocardiogram shows a left bundle 

branch pattern with no change in configuration from previous 

tracings.  His other laboratory studies are pending. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The case was discussed with his 

physician, Dr. Echeverria.  We both agree that the patient has 

probably had a progression of his coronary syndrome with possible 

unstable plaque, given his episode of shortness of breath and 

paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  It is possible that he has silent 

ischemia, which is not evident because of the left bundle branch 

pattern.  Pending the other evaluation and studies, which are being 

sent at this time, the patient will require hospitalization for 

further medical management. 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Acute coronary insufficiency, coronary artery 

disease. 

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 

admitted to the hospital in stable condition.

Neurology Resident ED Consult Note 




Patient Name: Neill, Jennifer K

MRN: 4634248



PCP: Dr William Joslin



Date/Time/Place of Exam/Initial Assessment:   12/11/98, 8 PM, PMC ED.



Reason for Consult: Abnormal speech



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 71 year-old right-handed woman with multiple medical problems who presents with subacute speech abnormality.  



She was well before going to bed on 12/09/98.  In the morning of 12/10, her husband noticed that she was repeating the same word &#8220;lawyer&#8221; and the rest of her speech was garbled.  Patient subsequently states that she had word-finding difficulties, but denies comprehension problem.  There was no other neurologic complaint per husband.  Of note, she has similar presentation a few years ago.  Over the course of today, her speech has improved but still not back to normal.    



Witnessed onset: No (time last seen normal: before bed on 12/09)

Mode of arrival: walk-in 

Clinical course: improving 

Pre-morbid neurological status: no disability 





There have been no changes in vision or hearing, headaches, neck pain, tinnitus, vertigo, loss of consciousness, weakness, numbness, difficulty with comprehension, speaking, language, swallowing, eating, balance or gait. General review of systems was negative for fevers, chills, rashes, change in weight, energy level or appetite, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, bleeding diathesis, and change in bowel or bladder habits (i.e incontinence).





PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 

-- Diabetes- since 2084

-- Hypertension

Lisinopril 20mg BID
 
Simvastatin 20mg QHS
 
Glucovance 2.5/500 2 tab BID
 
Flovent





ALLERGIES: NKDA



SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with husband, has three children, and is a retired interpreter. There is no history of smoking, excessive ETOH intake or illicit drug use.



FAMILY HISTORY: 

Father: died at age 89- ""old age""

Mother: died at age 87- Alzeimhers disease

Siblings: 2 siblings with DM



EXAMINATION:



General: Comfortable, in not acute distress, pleasant  



MS:        Alert and fully oriented, attentive, following 2-step cross body command, fluency decreased, naming impaired for low-frequency, calculation intact, reading intact, repetition intact, and praxis intact, no left and right confusion



CN:         VFF, PERRL 5-&gt;2mm, EOM intact without nystagmus, no ptosis, face and palate elevation and shoulder elevation symmetric, notable dysarthria, tongue midline



Motor:   Normal bulk and tone.  No tremor, rigidity, or bradykinesia. No pronator drift.  Full strength throughout



Coord:   Finger-to-nose, and heel-to-shin movements intact..



Reflex:   DTR symmetric throughout.  Toes are down bilaterally



Sens:      Light touch and temperature are decreased below the knees; joint position intact. No evidence of extinction.  



Gait:       Deferred







Labs/Studies:

See LMR



                                                                

Head CT (): 


     CT BRAIN: No definite evidence for acute intracranial pathology.  No 

     hemorrhage, mass lesion or evidence for acute territorial infarction.

      

     Stable chronic infarct involving the left frontal lobe.

      

     CTA HEAD: Occlusion of the distal right intradural vertebral artery 

     after the takeoff of the right PICA.  Normal appearance to the left 

     vertebral artery which courses to become the basal artery without 

     evidence of occlusion or significant stenosis.  The other 

     intracranial arteries demonstrate no evidence of significant stenosis 

     or occluded segment.  No aneurysm is visualized.  

      

     CTA NECK: Moderate stenosis of the proximal right cervical vertebral 

     artery secondary to atherosclerotic disease. The other cervical 

     vessels demonstrate no significant stenosis or dissection.





ASSESSMENT / PLAN:

This 71 year-old right-handed woman with multiple medical problems who presents with subacute impaired speech fluency.  



CT confirms infarct in left frontal lobe, age-undetermined.   The distal right intradural vertebral artery occlusion is likely chronic and incidental finding.  
MRI is contraindicated due to pacemaker



-          Out of the window for acute thrombolytics

-          Hold off on oral intake until swallow evaluation
; D5NS in the meantime
-          Repeat TTE: EF 20-25% in 3/98

-          Consider starting anticoagulation if EF remains poor (pending CMF team decision); continue with ASA for now

-          Rest of the stroke evaluation per CMF team

                                              2-4-65
 
 
 
HPI:  The patient is a 41 year old man with a history of non-insulin 
dependent diabetes, hypertension, obesity and substance abuse who I 
learned today was recently admitted for deep venous thrombosis and is 
presenting for follow up of his DVT.  The patient's current medical 
problems include:
1.   Recent DVT.  The patient was admitted between the days of 1-24 and 
     1-30 secondary to the development of a right lower extremity DVT.  
     The patient told me that he had been doing well and denied any 
     previous trauma to his leg or other predisposing factors such as long 
     car or airplane trips and he stated he had been as active as 
     previously over the recent few weeks.  The patient stated he awoke 
     in the morning of the 24th and noted tightness in his right 
     quadriceps and right calf.  He later developed progressive swelling 
     of the leg and therefore presented to the THD emergency 
     department.  He had lower extremity non-invasives performed which 
     confirmed the presence of a right lower extremity DVT.  He was 
     admitted and heparinized and then Coumadinized prior to discharge.  
     The patient disclosed a history that his daughter had a DVT at the 
     time of her pregnancy and therefore a hypercoagulability work-up was 
     sent off which was negative.  The patient currently returns to me 
     complaining of further right calf pain and swelling.  He states that 
     he was interested in physical therapy but states that that did not 
     occur during his hospital course.  The patient was also angry and 
     upset that I had not visited him during his hospital stay.  I 
     explained to him that I had not been notified of his admission or of 
     his emergency department visit.  I called all of the parties 
     responsible for his admission to clear the confusion that had 
     occurred.
 
2.   Hypertension.  The patient's previously been on anti-hypertensives 
     including lisinopril, unfortunately the patient has not tolerated ACE 
     inhibitors secondary to a severe cough and therefore these were 
     discontinued recently.  With a discontinuation of his drinking, the 
     patient's blood pressures have been under much better control.
 
3.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.  I recently started the patient on 
     insulin.  He was scheduled for a follow up visit but unfortunately 
     did not make his visit.  His insulin dose was adjusted during his 
     recent hospitalization and his current dosage is 35 units of NPH in 
     the morning and 15 units of regular.  In the evening he takes 10 
     units of NPH and 10 units of regular.  The patient does not yet have 
     a home glucometer.  We will arrange for this.

Page 2                                        46103196
                                              2-4-65
 
 
 
Physical Examination:  Vital signs showed a heart rate of 90.  Blood 
pressure: 135/92. Respiratory rate: 14 and unlabored.  HEENT: pupils 
equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, 
oropharynx clear. Mucous membranes moist. Cardiac: regular rate and 
rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lungs: clear to 
ausculation. Abdomen soft, nontender with active bowel sounds.  
Extremities:  There was notable edema of his right lower extremity with 
significant pain and a positive Homan's sign.  
 
Impression:
1)   DVT.  Given his current physical examination, and lack of recent PT 
     check since time of discharge on the 30th, I am sending a stat PT.  I 
     encouraged the patient to elevate the leg. My feeling is that the DVT 
     has not successfully been treated and that likely his PT is not 
     therapeutic at the present time.  I have arranged for the patient to 
     follow up with Aguilar, the Internal Medicine nurse, on Wednesday for a repeat 
     check of his PT.  I left instructions that I should be called 
     immediately upon receiving the PT value, I also arranged for the 
     patient to meet with the physical therapist for the provision of a 
     cane to help with ambulation. 
 
2)   Adult onset diabetes.  I will recheck a hemoglobin A1C value at his 
     next office visit.  A finger stick in the office approximately three 
     hours after eating is 253.  I feel this is still too elevated.  I 
     will therefore adjust his insulin dose when I see him next week.  I 
     will follow up with the patient next week and make any necessary 
     adjustments in his medications at that time.

RACINE, MAINE				Name:	Quiana Justus

                                                NIHC #:	981-40-48

PROGRESS NOTE					DOB:		







Quiana is a 72-year-old woman who comes in for follow-up of her hypertension.  Please see her current medication list.  She also has a history of diabetes.  



Over the past few weeks to one month she has been having intermittent right shoulder pain.  It is worse with lifting.  The pain is in her deltoid muscle and radiates a little bit across her upper back.  It is worse if she actually lies on her shoulder at night.  There is no history of trauma, no neck pain, no upper extremity numbness or weakness except for occasional left thumb numbness.  The thumb numbness resolves if she shakes her hand.



She is also having bilateral knee pain when she walks.  There is no swelling or effusion or heat in her knees.  She had been on Vioxx for her spinal stenosis but stopped it because it was not helping her spinal stenosis pain.  Instead for her shoulder pain she has been taking Advil 200 mg 2 and up to 6 per day. She takes the Advil with food or milk and is not having any GI upset from it.  



She is having a lot of stresses with her husband, whom she feels may have some early memory problems.  His mini-mental status on his last exam was a 30/40.  However, he makes, according to her, arbitrary decisions, does not complete projects he starts, and not as task-oriented as he used to be.  He does not complete tasks or shopping errands that she would like him to do.  We discussed that he should make a follow-up appointment to see me to repeat his mini-mental status exam, but that some of these problems are not likely to be easily resolvable, and that she might benefit from finding ways to manage her anxiety and stress level.  She does get very anxious and upset at times.  She had been considering taking Ativan p.r.n. when she gets very upset and frustrated.  She is also having stressors with her grandson, who lives next door and has a problem with substance abuse and questionable money issues.  



She denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or edema.  She is on her diabetes medication.  She likes going to work because that gets her out of the house.



ON EXAMINATION:  She is a pleasant, animated woman in no acute distress.  Her blood pressure initially was 160/80.  After discussing her situation with her husband, her blood pressure was 180/85.  Neck supple without JVD or bruits.  Lungs are clear without rales or rhonchi.  Cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm and normal S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs.  She has no peripheral edema.

 

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)	Hypertension, poor control.  Will increase her Zestril to 40 mg p.o. q.d.  Her daughter, Iyanna Field who is a registered nurse, will continue to monitor her blood pressure.  

(2)	Right shoulder pain.  On exam she has good range of motion of her shoulder and her muscle strength and reflexes are intact.  She can continue the Advil p.r.n. but should take it with antacids or something to protect her stomach.  



(3)	Adult-onset diabetes.  We will check her Hemoglobin A1c.  



She will follow up for her complete physical in May.

	Reason for visit:
   72 y.o. admit s/p cardiac catherization revealing patent LAD stent


	Interval History:
   72 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, and CAD. He sufferred a NSTEMI on 8/30/35. A cath at that time revealed an occluded mid LAD lesion, a 75% ostial OM2 stenosis, a 90% OM4 stenosis, and a non-dominant RCA with a 90% stenosis. His LVEF was estimated at 25-30% with moderate MR. He was discharged home on 9/02/35 to orbit for future CABG. 
9/03/35 He was admitted to Natchaug Hospital secondary to recurrent rest pain. n 9/04/35 Echo revealing moderate MR with no other significant valvular abnormalities. There was segmental left ventricular dysfunction involving the septal, apical, inferior, and anterior territories. EF 55%.  There was segmental right ventricular dysfunction involving the apex. The plan was for this patient to undergo CABG; however the patients wife was involved in a serious MVA, and with further discussion the decision was made to take him to the cath lab to attempt PCI so that the patient could be with his wife as soon as possible. 
9/05/35 He was taken to the CCL. mid LAD had a 100% occlusion after the D1. The D1 was a small vessel with an ostial, eccentric, 90% lesion. The OM2 had a 60% eccentric lesion that did not appear flow limiting. The LPDA had a 95% complex lesion in the proximal third. He underwent stenting of the native mid LAD with a  Xience OTW 2.5 X 23mm stent with an excellent result. This was followed by kissing-balloon angioplasty of the ostium of the 1st diagonal and the LAD. The pre-intervention stenosis was 90% with 0% residual stenosis. Finally, stenting of the proximal third of the left PDA was performed using a Xience V 2.5 x 15mm and a 2.5 x 12mm stent. The pre-intervention stenosis was 95% with 0% residual stenosis. At the end of the case, there was TIMI III flow throughout with no perforation or dissection. The patient remained stable throughout the rest of the admission with no further chest discomfort. He was discharged home on 9/06/35. 

Since his discharge he has noticed that he was dyspneic with lying flat. He has also noticed some exertional fatigue and dyspnea. He presented to Natchaug Hospital for further evaluation.  His ECG showed no acute changes, CXR consistent with mild CHF.  He has been aggressively diuresed with improvement  in his level of dyspnea. He was transferred to GCH for a repeat cardiac catheterization. 
Cath today revealing:  Widely patent LAD and LPDA stents. Balloon angioplasty site of proximal D1 patent. Nondominant RCA with 90% proximal lesion Severe cardiomyopathy with mid-distal anterior, apical, and mid-distal inferior hypokinesis. EF 25% with LVEDP 20. Moderate mitral regurgitation.

FERRARA, LAUREN

48185437

11/19/2062





HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Ferrara returns for followup visit.  She is now approximately one month out from a redo left popliteal to peroneal artery bypass graft using a basilic vein from right arm.  Postoperatively, she did well, although she was very sensitive to pain medication in the hospital and it was difficult to get her moving.  She complains of persistent weakness and numbness in her right hand and some pain shooting into her right forearm.  According to the patient, this was present early during her hospitalization, but because of other issues, it was not paid very much attention.  She denies any significant pain in the leg.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, she appears generally well.  The right arm harvest site is healed well and the upper arm is soft without any evidence of hematoma, whatsoever.  The hand is warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses; however, she clearly has weakness of flexion of the first and second digits and some weakness of opposition.  She appears to have intact ulnar and radial function.  The lower extremity incision has also healed well and there is a strong Doppler signal over the peroneal artery at the ankle.  The foot is warm and well perfused and the previous ischemic lesion on the big toe is healing.  She had a followup graft scan today, which revealed her bypass graft to be patent with no evidence of significant narrowing.  The ankle index was measured at 0.88 on the left and 0.64 on the right.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Ferrara lower extremity circulation is stable and her bypass graft is functioning nicely.  Unfortunately, she appears to have had some neuropathic complication in her right arm that may have been related to her vein harvest surgery.  The exam suggests some possible partial comprise of median nerve function.  In any case, she is able to function reasonably well and a course of occupational therapy may improve things.  There is no evidence of compression from hematoma and no evidence of infection.  We will continue to follow her closely with a return visit scheduled in six weeks and a course of therapy was prescribed.

Dear Nurse Rivas, 


We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.  The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Franklin Feliciano. 


Ruath Doss is a 58yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, and hypercholesterolemia who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.  She was last seen here March 4th, at which time she was having difficulty tasting food.  This finding was not replicated on clinical exam, and her exam was otherwise unremarkable; it was theorized that her symptoms may have been due to a drastic alteration in her diet.  Less likely possibilities included a viral illness and side effect of hydrochlorthiazide.  Otherwise, she had recovered well from her strokes, and had not had additional seizures.  


Mrs. Doss continues to do well.  She reports that her taste came back eventually; she did stop the hydrochlorthiazide under your direction, but is not sure if it was associated with the recovery of her taste.  She continues to eat healthfully, and in fact has lost 30 lbs since her hospitalization.  Via your office, she has completed a cardiac stress test as recommended after suffering a NSTEMI during her last hospitalization.  She has had an abdominal ultrasound which may have shown a gallstone, although she is unsure of the exact results.  Finally, she informs me that an appointment with Dr. Yuhas of Neurosurgery has been scheduled for August in order to follow up an incidental small L A2 aneurysm.  


Mrs. Doss continues to take Plavix for secondary stroke prevention (she has G6PD deficiency).  Her dentist would like to take her off this medication for a week before an extensive outpatient procedure which would include deep root cleaning.  However, she is nervous about the risk of another stroke.  She continues to tolerate her Dilantin well; there had been a question in April about a low level, but the test had been inadvertently performed in the setting of a held dose, and on repeat testing was within goal at 12.6.  She denies any seizure-like activity: no staring or shaking spells, or episodes of incontinence or tongue biting.  She reminds me that her 6 month anniversary of seizure free activity is approaching, and thus is hoping that she might be able to resume driving.  


She denies changes in vision, focal weakness or numbness, difficulty with language comprehension or production.  She does have occasional mild headaches exacerbated by the summer heat.  She sometimes feels as though she has ""creepy crawly things in my head,"" a sensation similar to when she had a Mohs procedure.

Studies: 
CTA head (5/01/90): No significant interval change in the distal left A2 segment aneurysm.


Assessment and Recommendations:


58yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.   She is overall doing very well, and has been very meticulous with her healthcare after her hospitalizations in December.  We discussed the very small risk of stroke if Plavix is held for a dental procedure.  The daily risk of stroke is so small, and the benefit of proper mouth care so great, that we would agree with holding clopidogrel.  If she does not want to stop antiplatelet medication before the procedure, the only alternative would be a heparin or Lovenox bridge.  However, such a measure would seem to be extreme, especially as her overwhelming stroke risk factors at the time of the CVA were her diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, all of which she has taken significant strides to better control.  Mrs. Doss was still nervous about suspending the Plavix; ultimately, she will decide on the optimal course of action.  


Mrs. Doss will have repeat cholesterol panel tested at your office to assess her response to the increased dose Lipitor and dietary changes.  Her lipoprotein(a) level was high at 89 at the time of her hospitalization, and we will repeat this lab today to ascertain whether it has remained elevated.  I have also written her a letter certifying that, as of July 3rd, she will have been seizure free for 6 months time on a stable dose of Dilantin.  She emphasizes that she would call my office or go to the Emergency Department immediately if there she were to have any seizure-like episodes.  If she remains event free for two years, we may consider discontinuing her antiepileptic medication.  


Although the incidentally noted L A2 aneurysm is reassuringly stable on CTA, I have asked her to confirm her follow up appointment with Neurosurgery, as I do not see the date noted in the computer.  Finally, we will obtain a repeat carotid ultrasound this fall to ensure that the irregular R ICA plaque has not progressed.  
Of note, Dr. Franklin Feliciano was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam. Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.  Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient. I will see her back in clinic in 4-6 months time.   




Sincerely,

Check EPO level, follow CBC.     11/21/2077:   EPO level inappropriately low.  Therefore, suspect anemia is secondary to age-related reduction in renal mass/GFR.



Hypertension

On low-dose ACE inhibitor and beta blocker.  Blood pressure today uncharacteristically elevated, 150/70.  He attributes this to rushing to get to his appointment with me.  Blood pressure earlier this month was 120/55 at his pulmonary visit.  I suspect that he is probably well controlled overall.  For now, no change in management.

RE:  Urania Yerger
     MR #583-48-90-0

Dear Dr. Dillon:

I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today in Titonka Care Center in
follow-up of her coronary artery disease (CABG 10/78) and heart failure.  At her last visit her
heart failure had improved, but she still was hypertensive.  We increased both her Losartan and
her Toprol dosing.  Today her blood pressure is substantially improved.  She has generally been
feeling well.  She has continued to walk outside the home with her daughters, going shopping. 
She denies orthopnea or PND.  She has had stable ankle edema.  

Her current medications are aspirin 325 mg PO q. day, Lasix 40 mg PO q. day, Glipizide 10 mg
PO q. day, Losartan 100 mg PO q. day, Toprol XL 100 mg PO q. day, Simvastatin 10 mg PO q.
day, Avandia, and multivitamins.

On physical examination, her blood pressure today is 130/60.  Her heart rate is in the high 60s. 
She is comfortable seated on the examination table.  Her jugular venous pressure is less than 8. 
Her chest examination has a few coarse crackles at the bases.  Cardiac examination reveals a
non-displaced PMI with normal intensity S1 and S2.  She has a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur
at the apex and a grade II crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the right upper sternal
border.  She has 1 - 2+ edema of both lower extremities and they are warm to touch.

Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals.  There are
nonspecific ST abnormalities.

Overall, Ms. Yerger has improved significantly with better control of her blood pressure.  She
has signs of very mild volume overload on examination, with preserved perfusion.  We elected
to maintain her present dosing, but discussed increasing her dose to 40 mg PO q. a.m. and 20 mg
PO q. p.m. should her lower extremity edema increase or her weight rise.

Major Problems



Diabetes mellitus (adult onset)

Aug 13

S: Has history of DM2 for 20(+)years c/b peripheral neuropathy for which Mr. Jacobs takes amytriptyline with good effect. He has a hx of iritis and retinitis recently treated with steroids.  He follows-up with the Rusk State opthamologists. For foot care he sees a podiatrist at the RSH as well. There is no history of diabetic ulcer or cellulitis. He is maintained on glyburide 2.5mg for several years and he checks his BS qd with range of 100-150 and occasional episodes of hypoglycemia. His last AIC was 4.4% in 9/95. At this time his UA showed no proteinuria and his renal function is within normal limits. He is on an ACEi. His diabetic care is well managed at the Diabetic clinic by Whitney Bullock. 

P: c/w glyburide and current endocrine/optho/podiatry care.



Atherosclerotic coronary vascular disease

S: Mr. Jacobs has a hx of anteroseptal MI in 2092 and is s/p left main stent placement. In July of 2095, he had a TTE which was remarkable for an EF of 23%, reduced from 31% in 2092. Also notable for anteroseptal AK and infero-posterior HK. AD-MIBI in 9/95 with anteroseptal scar, but no ischemia. Does about 30 minutes of aerobic physical activity each morning without issue. No CP or SOB. Denies orthopnea, PND, LE edema. 

P: DM (AIC 4.4) and lipid control (LDL 59) is optimal. Medical Regimen consists of  ASA, BB, ACEi, Statin. Is a patient of Dr. Dunham and plan to see him annually. I wonder if he should be anticoagulated given his diffuse HK and whether he should be considered for BiV pacing.

EDVISIT^28297534^OGRADY, MICHAEL^03/16/98^OCASIO, GEORGE OJAS

I saw this patient with resident Dr. Elijah Parker.  Please see

his note for further details.  I confirm that I have interviewed

and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation

on the patient's chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of

care, and disposition with the patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old male

with a history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery

disease, previous MI, and esophageal cancer with mets to lung,

status post VATS, and a recent hemothorax and chest tube.  He was

discharged 2 days ago, now presenting with increasing cough.  He

had been seen in an outside hospital earlier today and diagnosed

with a right lower lobe pneumonia.  He was also given 1 g of

ceftriaxone.  His complaints prior to presentation had been chest

pain as well as shortness of breath, abdominal discomfort, and

palpitations.  On reviewing his chart, he had had his diltiazem

and Lopressor discontinued on his last admission.  Other systems

were reviewed and found to be negative including fevers, chills,

hemoptysis, or difficulty swallowing.

MEDICATIONS:  Reviewed.  Please see the chart.  He is currently

on aspirin and took today.

ALLERGIES:  IV dye and Neurontin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, but cachectic

appearing, and nontoxic.  Temperature 98, pulse of 111,

respirations 20, blood pressure 104/61, and oxygen saturations

are 95%, however, this is on 5 liters.  HEENT exam:  Mucosal

membranes are dry.  Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. 

Lungs:  Crackles at the right lung.  Left lung is clear.  CVS: 

Tachycardic but regular.  Abdomen:  There is some mild diffuse

tenderness in the upper quadrants, no rebound or guarding, and no

Murphy's.  He has normoactive bowel sounds.  Skin is warm and

dry.  Back is nontender at CVA points.  He has got bilateral

lower extremity edema, but no tenderness in the thighs and

calves.  Neurologically, he is somewhat somnolent, but oriented

without focal motor or sensory deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count is elevated at 19,300, 90% polys, 2

bands.  Chemistries are normally slightly perhaps more dehydrated

with creatinine of 1.3, which is a little above his baseline of

1.2 when he was discharged.  LFTs are all normal including lipase

and total bilirubin; however, his alkaline phosphatase is mildly

elevated.  First set of cardiac enzymes is negative.  EKG shows a

sinus tachycardia with PVCs and nonspecific inferior ST-T wave

changes.  Chest x-ray shows bilateral basilar nodules, which have

been there in the past.  There is a hazy opacity in the right mid

hemithorax, which does not look new, however, this could

represent tumor versus pneumonia.  However, no significant change

prior to his discharge.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Given his dyspnea and his elevated

white count, this case was discussed with Oncology.  He was

admitted for dyspnea, ruling out pneumonia.  He is in stable

condition.

NAME:     Wilson, Gabriel

MRN:     8514931



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Gabriel Wilson is a 72-year-old Croatian

female, referred by Dr. Fraser for evaluation of complaints of dizziness. Her daughter,

who is a Library Manager here, accompanies her mother today. Apparently, for

many years, perhaps as many as five, her mother has complained of ""feeling pulled""

when she walks. This never occurs when lying down or sitting. It is only when she is

walking that she feels she is being pulled, either to the right, left, forward or

backward. At times, she does visibly veer when she walks. She has had one fall a

number of months ago when she broke her wrist. She has not had any subsequent

falls. There is no associated true spinning vertigo, no associated visual change,

numbness, weakness, change in gait, change in speech and no headache. She actually

feels that over the past few weeks, it has been a little better, though prior to that, it

was a little more severe. Unable to associate this with any clear intervention.

Unaware of any precipitating or alleviating symptoms. 



Review of other systems notable for general fatigue. Otherwise unremarkable. No

chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain. 



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hepatitis B, diabetes, hypertension, GE reflux,

hyperlipidemia, depression, cataracts. 



MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Colace, Cozaar, Flonase, Fosamax, hydrochlorothiazide,

Lopid, meclizine p.r.n., Protonix, Prozac, Vioxx. 



FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for neurologic disease. 



SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is widowed and lives with her niece. She neither drinks nor

smokes. 



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam, she is a pleasant, quiet, soft-spoken,

72-year-old female. BP 140/84. Cranial nerves II through XII intact to detailed exam,

except for decreased hearing on the left. On motor exam, no rigidity, no drift. Good

power throughout upper and lower extremities. She does, however, seem mildly

bradykinetic diffusely. Finger tapping was slow bilaterally and symmetric. Amplitude

is normal for finger tapping. Power in the lower extremities 5/5. Sensory exam with

mild vibratory loss in the toes. Finger-to-nose testing intact. Foot-tapping decreased

bilaterally. Romberg sway. Her gait is slightly wide-based, with occasional veering to

either side. She is unable to perform tandem. DTR's 2+ throughout, except for 1+

ankle jerks. Babinski flexor bilaterally. 



DATA: MRI/MRA of the brain 8/30 shows mild to moderate white matter

hyperintensity in the corona radiata, centrum semiovale and moderate bilateral

pontine involvement and multifocal lacunar infarcts of the lentiform nuclei, right

internal capsule and bilateral thalami. Intracranial atherosclerosis is seen involving the

anterior middle cerebral arteries with a greater degree of involvement of the

posterior cerebral arteries and intermittent development of moderate mid-segment

stenosis of the basilar artery. Bloodwork 2/27: SMA7 normal, except glucose 134. 8/30

bili, total protein, albumin, globulin within normal limits. LFT's normal except SGOT

elevated at 46. 



IMPRESSION: 72-year-old female with diabetes, chronic hepatitis C and

hypertension, complaining of basically veering of her gait and feeling unsteady. She is

symptomatic only when she walks. Her exam is notable for mild vibratory loss in the

toes, likely due to diabetic neuropathy, bilateral lower-extremity dysmetria and the

wide-based, at times veering gait. It appears that her gait difficulties with veering  are

multifactorial, due to history of multiple lacunar infarcts and peripheral neuropathy.

It does not appear that these episodes are due to transient ischemic attacks, given

that she veered in the office while walking and stated that this was the symptom she

is concerned about.  However, given her mid-segment basilar stenosis seen on MRI,

she certainly could become symptomatic from this down the road, particularly if she

became hypotensive. As she was unable to tolerate Aggrenox, will try adding

Persantine at a lower dose at 25 mg b.i.d., along with an aspirin per day, to see if she

can tolerate gradually increased doses of Persantine. I will see her in follow up in two

months to see how she is doing. May also consider checking CBC, given her

symptoms of fatigue and other bloodwork should these symptoms persist.

Ickes, Jr., William

81071628

02/02/79



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Ickes comes in with pain in his right 

hip, left shoulder and for follow up of his coronary artery disease and 

his left wrist.  



His right hip continues to be painful at times.  A radiogram in December 

showed that he has osteoarthritis in that hip.  He has been taking 

Motrin twice a day and finds that he does get some relief with that.



His left shoulder has been bothering him for awhile but it is actually 

is somewhat better than it has been.  It hurts to abduct him more than 

90 degrees or to reach behind his back.



His left wrist is bothering him some now.  It is sore with most types of 

motion.



Regarding his diabetes, his blood sugar today was 190 early this 

morning.



Regarding his coronary disease, he has been walking every morning.  He 

has had no chest pain pressure or discomfort.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 110/70, weight is 192 pounds, 

pulse is 70 and regular.  He is a pleasant black man in no apparent 

distress.  Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Chest 

is clear to auscultation and percussion.  Cardiac, S1, S2, regular rate 

and rhythm, no murmurs or gallops.  Abdomen is soft.  Extremities, 

without edema.  Right hip, no pain with leg rolling.  Left shoulder is 

able to abduct to 90 degrees with no discomfort at all and is able to 

abduct completely with only minimal discomfort.  It is nontender to 

palpation.  Left wrist, he is a little tender over the medial joint 

line.  



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:



1.	Right hip:  I think he has degenerative joint disease and I want him 

to continue on the Motrin as needed.

	

2.	Left shoulder:  I may well have bursitis here.  He feels this has 

improved a lot and he would just as soon not do anything different 

for now but will let me know if it causes more problems.

3.	Left wrist:  He probably also has some arthritis in his left wrist.  

He is tender in the joint line today.  It is bothering him a little 

bit but not enough that he would like to do anything about it.

	

4.	Coronary disease:  He has been doing well from this prospective.  He 

has no recent chest pain, pressure or discomfort and his LDL has been 

very well controlled.

	

5.	Diabetes:  His last hemoglobin A1c was slightly elevated and we will 

check another one today.  I will have him follow up with Olga in 

PIMA regarding his diabetic control.

Major Problems





Coronary artery disease

The patient had recatheterization in May demonstrating 30% stenosis at the stent on the LAD.  He has diffuse disease, otherwise with good collateralization.  His exercise tolerance test in May showed excellent exercise tolerance, but positive images and positive tracings for ischemia.  His Duke ETT score was -10, but his perfusion images showed moderate reversibility in the inferior myocardium with fixed defect anteriorly.  He had infero-apical hypokinesis with an EF of 45%.  It is also noted that his blood pressure fell, but normalized during exercise.  The patient has been stable until last several weeks when he has noted some lower jaw symptoms anteriorly.  He has no chest squeezing, neck squeezing, or jaw pain, but there is an odd sensation under the front teeth.  He correlates this with exercise, but not consistently.  He also occasionally feels this at rest.  He is able to walk uphill and generate a pulse of 90.  He is working doing heavy labor in the garden, moving, and digging.  It is not clear that this represents angina, but we will let Dr. Null know.  He is seeing Dr. Null in three to four weeks.     01/13/2072: .  The patient has been improving steadily since his last admission for CABG in November 2070.  He states his exercise tolerance is steadily improving and he is able to walk 2 miles at a rate of 17 minutes per mile without dyspnea or fatigue.  He has no chest pain or palpitations.  He does worry about bradycardia and states his metoprolol of 50 mg BID may be too much.  He has been withholding half to full dose in the evenings when he finds his pulses about 50.  He has no symptoms of forgetfulness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness.  He does have cold extremities.  There is no weight gain, weight loss, or orthopnea.  He remains on beta blocker, lipitor, Diovan, hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, and warfarin.  He is no longer on Plavix.  He has no nitrate.  On exam, he is somewhat hypertensive, but lungs are good and there is no elevated JVP.  His EKG shows first-degree AV block and I have asked him to bring that to Dr.  Null's office today.  

A: Stable. 

P: Continue medicines as they are because of borderline blood pressure today.  We would not escalate



Elevated blood pressure

The patient is on Diovan, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol.  He states his blood pressure at home is usually quite good and he feels it is responsive to external stressors.  I have asked him to think hard about removing those stressors from his life in order to maintain health.



Hyperlipidemia

The patient remains on 40 mg of lipitor.  It has been a year since we have checked his excellent results and we will check today.  He has been fasting for 12 hours.



Iron deficiency anemia

We will recheck his indices today.  He is not fatigued or pale.



Renal carcinoma

The patient had repeat MRI and CT in January at the Healthwin Hospital.  These were read as stable and he needs no intervention other than continued monitoring at six-month intervals.  He is quite reassured by this.



Seborrheic keratosis

The patient is ready for evaluation by Dermatology.  He has several atypical-looking keratoses as well as poorly rounded lesions consistent with BCCs.  I have referred him to Dermatology today.

This patient was interviewed and examined by me exclusively.

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient is a 67-year-old 

male who has known atherosclerotic coronary heart disease 

manifested by myocardial infarction approximately five years ago.  

He also has congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 

25%, and this is thought to be due to alcoholic cardiomyopathy 

given a substantial history of alcohol ingestion.  Over the past 

several months, he has stopped taking his medicine because he could 

not get to his doctor and felt he could not buy the medicine.  Over 

the past two weeks, he has been beset by palpitations and dyspnea 

on exertion as well as palpitations at rest.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He has had no vomiting, diaphoresis, radiation 

of the pain, change in bowel habits or any cough.  All of the 

systems are negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  He has had no significant surgeries.

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  He consumes alcohol slightly, 

once smoked in the past, but does not any longer.  He lives with 

his family.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Physical examination shows a 

patient who is awake, alert, calm and oriented.  He is in no 

distress at the time of examination.  EYES:  He had no scleral 

icterus.  NECK:  There was no adenopathy.  His thyroid was not 

palpable.  CHEST:  His chest was clear.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  His 

cardiovascular exam showed a regular rate and rhythm.  ABDOMEN:  

His abdomen was soft and nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  His extremities 

showed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  SKIN:  He had no rash.  

NEURO:  Neurologic exam was physiologic.

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Electrocardiogram showed tachycardia and 

T-wave inversion diffusely, which was unchanged from prior 

electrocardiogram.  His CK and troponin were unremarkable.  His 

troponin was 1.1, which was similar to a previous admission.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was treated with beta 

blocker and aspirin in the Emergency Department.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:

1.  Angina pectoris.

2.  Hypertension.

3.  Tachycardia.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was  

admitted to the Medical service for further evaluation.  He was 

admitted in satisfactory condition.

2. Bilateral hip pain - given subacute nature of this worsening problem, I would obtain a CT scan of the lower abdomen/pelvis to r/o any drainable fluid collections that we cannot appreciate on PE.

3. Long term plan - I have discussed with Mr. Quin that we are likely headed toward needing a surgical urinary diversion with an ileal conduit. He understands this and is still considering this. We will continue this discussion in outpatient follow up.

Visit Note




Patient Name: URQUHART, WENDELL Y                                          MRN: 5747359



Dictated Date: 06/25/2133                                        Dictated By: Ubaldo Daugherty, MD
.



Date of Visit: 06/25/2133








CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right buttock pain with right lower extremity radiation. 




HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  I had the pleasure of seeing Wendell Urquhart in follow-up today. He underwent right piriformis injection under fluoroscopic guidance on 06/10/2133. The patient reports greater than 50% improvement in his symptoms after the procedure. Currently the pain is intermittent. He describes it as sore sensation in the right buttock. He grades intensity of pain as 2/10 on the numerical pain scale. The symptoms are worse with prolonged walking for more than 2 miles a day and completely alleviated with rest. There is no change in the intensity of symptoms with Valsalva maneuver. The patient denies any recent fever or chills, no loss of bowel or bladder control, no numbness, no weakness, no unexplained weight loss. 





REVIEW OF MEDICAL HISTORY: During today's visit, I have reviewed past medical, social and family history, medication list and allergies. There has been no interval change as compared to the previous visit. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for musculoskeletal complains as described above. No recent fever, no chills, no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no abdominal pain, no loss of bowel or bladder control, no unexplained weight loss. The rest of the systems were reviewed and are negative.



PHYSICAL EXAM: The patient is alert and oriented to time, person and place. His mood and affect are stable. He demonstrates good attention and concentration. He ambulates without an assistive device with normal heel strike and toe-off. He is able to stand on heels and toes. He is able to walk heel-to-toe in a straight line with intact balance. There is limited range of motion in the lumbar spine with flexion limited to 80 degrees, extension limited to 20 degrees. There is no tenderness to palpation over piriformis muscles, paraspinal muscles, spinous processes, SI joints, or greater trochanteric bursa bilaterally. There is full 5/5 strength in the lower extremities with intact sensation bilaterally. 1+ reflexes in the knees, absent reflexes in the ankles bilaterally. There is downgoing Babinski, no clonus, normal tone in the lower extremities. Straight leg raise and femoral stretch test are negative bilaterally. There is pain with right hip internal rotation. 




IMPRESSION:

1.  Piriformis syndrome.

2.  Lumbar spondylosis with degenerative disk disease.

3.  Right hip arthropathy.




RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.  I had lengthy discussion with the patient about his condition and further treatment options. The patient will continue with home exercise program that he learned in physical therapy.

2.  The patient was encouraged to remain active and to participate in low-impact aerobic exercises as along as it does not exacerbate his symptoms.

3.  The patient was counseled on the benefits of weight reduction. He was informed about Weight Center here at Brooksville Regional Hospital. He is trying to control his weight through a balanced diet and aerobic exercises. He will consider an evaluation at the Weight Center if those approaches are not successful.

4.  The therapeutic plan was discussed with the patient. All of his questions were answered. In fact greater than 50% of today&#8217;s 25 minute visit was spent on counseling and coordination of care. I asked the patient to follow-up with me as needed if his symptoms return. 




It was my pleasure to follow-up with him.

EDVISIT^42272668^SPARKS, CHARLES^8/13/2079^SORENSEN, SAUL

This patient was seen with resident, Dr. Leach.  Resident's note

was reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined by me, and I

confirm the resident's findings.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, this is a 74-year-old

gentleman who presents with 2 days of chills, fevers, fatigue,

and increased urinary frequency.  He has no other complaints or

associated symptoms.

Please review resident's note for full details of past medical

history, social history, review of systems, medications, and

allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I confirm the physical exam is as

documented.  The patient is awake, alert, in mild to moderate

respiratory distress, breathing with a respiratory rate at 34,

oximetry noted at 88% on room air, temperature is 102 Fahrenheit,

pulse is 104, blood pressure is 213/89, and oximetry came up

nicely to 93% on 4 liters and 100% on nonrebreather facemask. 

Neck is supple.  Mucous membranes are dry.  Lungs reveal slightly

decreased breath sounds at the bases; however, there are few

crackles noted in the left lower base.  Heart is tachycardic but

regular.  The remainder of the exam is unremarkable.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count is noted at 11.6 and hematocrit

28.2.  This is close to the patient's baseline.  BUN and

creatinine 69 and 5.8, 5.8 is quite elevated for this patient. 

However, he has been evaluated for recent diagnosis of renal

failure by the Nephrology Service.  Bicarbonate is 21 and

potassium is 4.3.  Urinalysis reveals some blood and protein,

otherwise not suggestive of an infection.  EKG is tachycardic

with left ventricular hypertrophy in a strain pattern.  Chest

x-ray shows diffuse fluffy infiltrates bilaterally with bilateral

pleural effusions, few Kerley B lines, and fluid in the lungs

fissures.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was covered with

ceftriaxone and azithromycin for his presumed pneumonia.  He also

received nitro paste for preload reduction as well as a Foley

catheter and Lasix, all for his CHF.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to the hospital.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

DIAGNOSES:  Pneumonia, CHF, and renal failure.

Date of Admission: 8/09/2121
Attending: Thomas Wyatt
PCP: Ulisses Xuan (Santa Barbara General Hospital)
Source of History: Patient and medical record

CC/RFA: SOB, extremity edema, abdominal discomfort

HPI: This 53 yoM with a hx of morbid obesity, CHF, COPD, Diabetes and OSA reports a increase in his weight from 395 lb to 450 lb over the last 2-4 weeks. This occurred despite his efforts to lose weight and his active participation in a weight watchers weight reduction program. The weight gain was accompanied by abdominal distension and    bloating   , increased leg swelling and increasing SOB. He also reports severe DoE, with a maximal walking distance of 5-6 steps, as well as a deteriorating a scrotal edema with some dysuria, and rectal incontinence. Since the recent weight gain, he also developed an extensive itchy erythema in his groins.  He denies CP, diarrhea, HA, fever, chills, cough. His PCP prescribed metoclopramid and protonix for his abdominal complaints; however, the patient felt dizzy and dehydrated after taking these medications and decided to discontinue those. He also stopped taking his regular lasix medication about a week ago. Because of his increasing SOB, he called EMS, who found him cyanotic in his apartment with an Sa02 of 73% on RA. 

ED Course: On arrival in the ED, his VS were: T98, BP108/65, RR24, HR100, O2Sa 92% on 4L 02. He received one dose of lasix 80mg iv, urine output unrecorded. He was transferred to Internal Medicine for further management.

EKG: SR @90 BPM, low voltage, 1. degree heart block, right axis deviation

Radiology: 
CXR (portable): Low lung volumes.  Pulmonary vascular redistribution cannot be excluded on this semi upright film.
CXR (pa/lat): Mild pulmonary congestion with cardiomegaly. Small right pleural effusion. Stable elevated right hemidiaphragm.

Assessment and Plan:
53 yoM with hx of morbid obesity, CHF,  HTN, COPD, DM type 2, OSA, p/w increasing SOB and abdominal discomfort.
 
SOB: Most likely related to a combination of CHF flare (due to lasix discontinuation, BNP 1326) and COPD (PFT in 2120 indicated severe obstructive and restrictive deficit). CXR showing cardiomegaly and right-sided pleural effusion, consistent with CHF.  Started on oxygen, lasix, combivent nebs. Will reevaluate cardiac function with TTE. In the absence of CP, PE unlikely.  Cardiac enzymes negative. 
CHF: Currently treated with Verapamil for afterload reduction. Will consider to switch Verapamil to ACEI. Reinitiated Lasix. 
HTN: patient here normotensive. Currently taking verapamil, however, 1. degree heart block. Will consider switching to ACEI. 
OSA: Patient on home oxygen. Will suggest CPAP/BiPAP
Diabetes: Currently taking Glybyride, will obtain HBA1c here, keep on RISS while inpatient.
Abdominal discomfort/bloating: Most likely related to recent weight gain of 30 lbs, diabetic gastroparesis might also be contributing. Patient unable to tolerate metoclopramide. Discussed possibility of gastric bypass, patient rejects.
Rectal incontinence: Might be related to diabetic neuropathy. Patient also unable to perform anal hygiene because of obesity. 
Groin erythema: Suggestive of fungal infection. Will treat symptomatically with miconazole and obtain dermatology consult. 
RLE ulcer: Granulating leg ulcer, Will continue topical care.  
Prophylaxis: Fragmin SQ, Nexium
Code Status: Full

New Patient Visit







Chief Complaint of:  2nd opinion



History of Present Illness: 74 yo M who comes to the office in search of a second opinion about his care at the Boaz Nursing Home in Lynden. He has a hx of prostate CA diagnosed in 2059 at the BNH and had an RRP shortly thereafter at the BNH. Apparently his pathology showed extraprostatic extension and he received postop XRT. Apparently, he has remained disease free since this time until a PSA was checked this past October which was 3.53. He states that he had not had his PSA checked for a few years before this, admittedly perhaps because he had missed appointments. The Urologists at the BNH have since checked a bone scan and abdominal CT scan, all of which were negative. He has the reports here with him. The bone scan does show an abnormality at L5, but with data from plain films this appears to not be consistent with a met lesion. He also has had recurrent problems with bleeding from hemorrhagic radiation cystitis. This occurs once every few months or so and is not currently bothering him. He states that he is scheduled to have a cystoscopy at the BNH next week, however, is unsure if he has had a urine cytology done.





Impression: In reviewing the patient's limited records that he brings and his history, it appears that he has had the appropriate care at the BNH. I have reassured him of this, and have indicated that he should just make sure that a urine cytology is also checked and that a repeat PSA be performed in the near future. I also informed him that he will likely need anti-androgen therapy in the future for further treatment of his prostate CA. He may follow up with me if he has questions in the future.

MRN:  6051778
Date of Admission: 8/03/07

PCP: Dr. Orelia Burns
Admitting Physician: Dr. Orelia Burns

Chief Complaint:  
	79 year old woman with DM-2 (7 years), HTN, on chronic immunosuppression for RA, presents with left lower leg erythema and swelling. 
History Obtained From:  
Patient, chart review

History of Present Illness:  
	This is a 79 year old woman with a long-standing history of RA on chronic immunosuppression (prednisone and now on methotrexate), DM-2 (HbA1c 5.5), previous history of leg surgeries with ?vasculitis, and prior history of cellulitis, who presents with a 1 week history erythema and swelling on right lower leg (anterior).  Ms. Do has had two prior hospitalizations for cellulitis/osteomyelitis. In 2104, she developed osteomyelitis following a fall, requiring surgery for debridment (right leg).  In 2106, she was also admitted to Seymour Hospital with cellulitis of right leg and required a 2-week course of IV antibiotics.  At this presentation, she has been in her usual state of health (ET 25 feet, limited by pain in legs, no dyspnea, no chest pain) until last Tuesday when she presented to her podiatrist for a corn removal (right foot). The podiatrist made an observation that she had some erythema on the dorsal part of the foot. She was not experiencing any pain.  Over this past week, she noted that the erythema and some swelling had extended, now to include the anterior portion of the lower shin.  She presented to EFHC for a follow-up appointment, and was treated with Keflex po.  Her cellulitis failed to improve and she presented to her PCP for evaluation on the day of admission, and was directly admitted to OGH.
	She denies any new fevers or chills (patient is having almost daily night sweats, which have been partially relieved with standing Tylenol intake. These night sweats, along with the weight loss and anorexia are in the process of being worked up at this time). She has had no cough, nasal discharge, headaches, diarrhea, or dysuria/burning.

Labs:
Recent labs pending
Radiology: 
CT Scan:  MILD SPLENOMEGALY WITH MULTIPLE DISCRETE SPLENIC LESIONS AND CALCIFIED FOCI.  DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS INCLUDES GRANULOMAS/SARCOIDOSIS.  ISOLATED LYMPHOMA IS ALSO A CONSIDERATION.  ON IMAGING IT IS DIFFICULT TO DIFFERENTIATE THESE PATHOLOGIES. 
	TWO DISCRETE LESIONS IN THE POSTERIOR CORTEX OF RIGHT KIDNEY ARE SUSPICIOUS FOR SOLID RENAL MASS OR HYPERDENSE CYST.
Assessment/Plan: 
	This is a 79 year old woman with past medical history of DM-2, chronic immunosuppresion (steroid use), RA, HTN, h/o leg ulcers, cellulitis and osteomyelitis, who presents with a 1 week history of left lower extremity swelling and erythema, without other symptomatic complaints, that has been resistant to po treatment
1.	Cellulitis - this woman is predisposed to cellulitis for a number of reasons, including chronic immunosuppression, diabetes, and prior surgeries to the area that have altered the anatomy and blood supply and lymphatic drainage.  Other potential causes include osteo or DVT. At this point, there is little to suspect osteo in this patient.
a.	Blood cultures
b.	Given her multiple problems, requires broad spectrum coverage - Zosyn 2.25 g IV q6 h (CrCl 45)
c.	Elevate the leg
d.	Warm compresses to increased circulation
e.	Mark the extent of cellulitis and monitor progression with therapy
f.	If cellulitis does not improve - will get imaging to evaluate for underlying infection. Will also get LENIS to rule out a DVT.
2.	Weight loss, anorexia, night sweats, now with R kidney mass - the differential for potential causes is very broad. She apparently had a negative PPD last year.  Extensive work-up to date was only notable for kidney cysts and mass
a.	Will attempt to schedule IR-guided biopsy
b.	Will stop ASA, plavix and celebrex in anticipation of the biopsy
c.	Continue to monitor fever curve
3.	Diabetes - patient is taking in normal diet, however in the setting of infection, will  put of home meds and do RISS/FSG
4.	HTN - continue Lisinopril
5.	RA - continue Prednisone and Methotrexate 
a.	Blood cultures (in the setting of patient's infection)
b.	Monitor fever curve and other vitals signs carefully
6.	Adrenal insufficiency - given patient's long term history of steroid use, she will need stress doses if becomes more acutely ill
7.	Prophylaxis - Nexium 20 qd; Fragmin 2500 U sc qd
8.	Code - DNI but wants chest compressions ""for a while"".  Healthcare proxy (Theresa  Kraft  270 Ridge Road/street, Little Elm, Mo 86277, tel 019-793-7578)

ID:  T2 N 0 M X, ER/PR + Her 2 Neu negative left invasive ductal carcinoma


Reason for visit: Monitoring of adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer


Initial Oncologic History:  
Ms. Ito first palpated a left breast lump in 2070. Two years later she was seen by her PCP and referred to surgery. In March '72 a mammogram showed a 1.6 cm left breast mass at 12 o'clock, also evident on ultrasonography. An additional group of indeterminate microcalcifications was noted in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. 
On 3/22/72 a biopsy of the left breast mass confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma. Stereotactic core biopsy of the upper outer quadrant calcifications showed only fibrocystic changes. On 5/31/72 she underwent a L lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy.  Pathology revealed a 2.0 x 2.5 x 2.3cm invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3,  with negative margins, ER+PR+Her2neu-, sentinel node negative. She was then referred to multidisciplinary clinic and received a recommendation for whole breast irradiation and adjuvant endocrine therapy.


INTERVAL HISTORY:  
Returns to see us for regular 6 month follow up. She had follow up chest imaging with her PCP which did not show evidence of pna. She is happy to hear this. She reports she is doing well at home. Son agrees. He is in the process of remodeling her home so it is handicap accessible. She can dress herself and wash herself. No new breast symptoms, pain or other concerns today.

	Assessment and plan:
   In summary, this is a very pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who had an MI in June 2077, which was a non-ST-elevation MI.  He underwent stenting of his LAD.  Since that time, he has not had any exertional angina.  He has no evidence of fluid retention or decompensated congestive heart failure.  Blood pressure is fine today.  Cholesterol is not perfect, but acceptable.  He is on a high dose of atorvastatin.  He is on a good medical regimen and at this point, I would keep him on his current medicines and plan to see him back in another six months.  He would like to enter a Cardiac Rehab Program and I think that certainly is a reasonable thing to do.

As always, it is a pleasure to be able to participate in the care of this very pleasant gentleman.

Best personal regards,

Sincerely yours,

RE: Michael Ogrady

       MR #631-90-33-7

 

Dear Dr. Patton:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Michael Ogrady in consultation for 

his coronary artery

disease, before his surgery for esophageal cancer.  As you know, this is a 

63-year-old male with a

long past medical history which includes diabetes, coronary artery disease, 

peripheral vascular

disease, hypertension, smoking history, hypercholesterolemia, DVT and newly 

diagnosed

esophageal carcinoma.  He has been followed by his cardiologist, Yehuda 

Landers, for the last nine

years.  Essentially he has every cardiac risk factor and known coronary 

artery disease which is

documented on cardiac catheterization performed on 1/20/93.  The 

catheterization demonstrated

right dominant system with 100% RCA lesion, a complex 30% diagonal 1 lesion 

and a 30%

marginal 1 lesion.  There was collateral flow noted from the LAD to the right 

PDA and from the

septal 2 branch to the RCA, and from the circumflex artery to the RCA.  The 

procedure was

performed through the right radial artery without complications.  Patient 

also has peripheral

vascular disease and is status post a left femoral posterior tibial saphenous 

vein bypass graft in

2088.  He is also status post atherectomy and dilatation of stenosis in the 

femoral to posterior

tibial graft.  He also had a left leg DVT in 2090.  His activity level is 

limited by his claudication. 

He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and diabetes on 

treatment.  

 

At baseline he has dyspnea on exertion after walking half a mile.  He gets 

chest pressure one to

two times a month.  However, his activity is extremely limited.  He reports 

that he has had a

positive stress test.  Further information is not available.  Patient 

understands he has coronary

disease, however does not have amenable disease for angioplasty.  On 

catheterization he had

preserved ejection fraction of 62%.  

 

He is to undergo esophageal cancer surgery in the next one to two months 

after receiving

chemotherapy and radiation therapy preop.  Patient states he will be 

receiving a Hickman

catheter and a jejunostomy tube placement before his chemo and radiation 

therapy. 

 

On physical exam, the patient is obese, weighing 288 pounds.  His blood 

pressure is 100/72,

heart rate is 57 bpm.  HEENT: oropharynx benign.  Neck: carotids intact 

bilaterally without

audible bruits.  Lungs: distant breath sounds.  Cor: without obvious jugular 

venous distention. 

Heart sounds distant.  Normal S1 and S2.  No appreciable murmurs.  Abdomen: 

unable to palpate

firm masses or aortic aneurysm.  Bowel sounds present.  Extremities: status 

post surgery to the

left flank with 1 to 2+ edema to the knee.  Distal pulses are absent.  Neuro: 

intact.

 

EKG: Sinus brady with first degree AV block.  IMI with age undetermined.  

Nonspecific STT

wave abnormalities present.  No previous EKG for comparison.

 

Impression: 63-year-old diabetic, hypertensive male with known coronary 

artery disease and

peripheral vascular disease who has preserved left ventricular function.  He 

clearly has ischemia

on a positive stress test.  I would recommend dobutamine echocardiogram to 

check ischemic

threshold.  He is clearly at intermediate risk for a perioperative cardiac 

event.  However, given

his life-threatening esophageal carcinoma, patient wants to proceed with 

surgery even

understanding possible complications.

 

Plan:

1.   Dobutamine echocardiogram to check ischemic threshold.

2.   Recommend intravenous beta-blockers during the surgery with fairly tight 

control of

     blood pressure and heart rate, utilizing the information determined on 

dobutamine

     echocardiography.

 

Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient, Michael 

Ogrady.  Please do

not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

 

Sincerely yours,

I have reviewed the resident's note on the record and seen and

examined the patient personally.  I concur with the resident's

findings.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is an extraordinarily

complex 47-year-old patient with renal insufficiency, nephrotic

syndrome, and severe anemia who was scheduled to receive some

intravenous iron today but the presence of multiple abnormalities

in her blood prompted her to be referred here instead for

admission.  She herself complains of generalized weakness but

does not have any localizing or acute new symptoms.  Remainder of

history and physical examination were reviewed and verified and

are as noted.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert.  Speech is

normal in rate, rhythm, and quality.  Skin is warm and dry.  She

is in no distress.  She has some bibasilar moist rales but heart

sounds are completely normal.

LABORATORY DATA:  As noted and have multiple abnormalities.  It

was reflected on the record.  Calcium is 5.5, albumin is 1.7,

creatinine is 7.0, and the remainder as noted.  Electrocardiogram

does not show any acute changes.

IMPRESSION:  This patient has anemia, hypocalcemia, and

hypomagnesemia.  We discussed this with the Internal Medicine who

will be admitting her to see if they can get her in better

metabolic balance.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:

1.  Anemia.

2.  Hypocalcemia.

3.  Hypomagnesemia.

4.  Nephrotic syndrome.

5.  Renal failure.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be admitted to hospital.

Dear Dr. Taylor:

 

Mrs. Joshi returns for followup.  Currently, she complains of

exertional fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and mild peripheral

edema.  Since last seen, she has continued to find it quite

difficult to lose weight, and has thus far declined seeing

members of our obesity clinic.  As you know, in the past, she

also has declined any consideration of attempted cardioversion or

other invasive studies.  Presently, she remains on a regimen of

enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., simvastatin 20 mg p.o.

q.d., metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., isosorbide nitrate 60 mg p.o.

q.d., Avapro 150 mg p.o. q.d., Actos 45 mg p.o. q.d., potassium,

10 mEq p.o. q.d. Pumex 2 mg p.o. q.d., Coumadin, magnesium oxide,

Humulin insulin 20 units subcutaneous q. a.m. along with 50 units

subcutaneous q. p.m., and Humalog 26 units subcutaneous q. a.m.

 

Physical examination reveals a markedly overweight woman in no

acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting at 106/62,

heart rate 65 and irregularly regular, respirations 16 and

unlabored, weight 306 lbs, which is 6 lbs above her weight 10

months ago.  The neck is soft.  JVP is flat.  Carotids without

significant bruits.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam reveals a

normal S1, a physiologically split S2, with a1-2/6 systolic

murmur radiating from apex to the base.  No significant diastolic

murmur or rub.  The abdomen is obese, but otherwise benign.

Extremities reveal 1-2+ bipedal edema, peripheral pulses are

intact albeit mildly diminished.

 

Electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation with a variable QRS

response.  The P waves are more organized than one might usually

see, suggesting the possibility of fibrillation/flutter as well. 

QRS 0.11, QT 0.38, axis 90 degrees, there is evidence of a prior

inferior myocardial infarction.  Compared with his last

electrocardiogram, there is no significant change.

 

Impression:  Mrs. Joshy continues to suffer from morbid obesity,

and I had a long discussion with her and her daughter regarding

the essential nature of her engaging in an aggressive weigh

reduction program.  I once again have strongly encouraged her to

make an appointment with our obesity clinic to assist in

extensive weight reduction.  I also discussed with her my

concerns regarding her symptoms of slowly progressive peripheral

edema, particularly as it pertains both to her weight, and atrial

or tachyarrhythmias.  As in the past, she told me that she would

refuse any consideration for attempted cardioversion or other

studies.  She did, however, agree to continue with her current

medical regimen.  I obtained routine blood studies today to

verify the adequacy of her lipid control and diabetes management.

 I have introduced her to Hayden Nutter, her nurse practitioner, who

will assist in trying to achieve a little more diuresis overt he

next few weeks.  We have given her a prescription for Zaroxylyn

to begin at 2.5 mg p.o. q.d., which will help result in some

degree of mild diuresis.  Nonetheless, she understands that

significant weight loss can only occur through a weight reduction

program.  I have of course explained to her the increased cardiac

morbidity associated with her current lifestyle.  Beyond this, I

have not altered her current medical regimen.

 

Of course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in his care.

 

Sincerely yours,

CC: Shortness of breath, neck pain.



HPI:  Ms. Riley was recently hospitalized in 11/69 for neck pain, chest pain, and SOB.  She had an extensive cardiovascular work-up that showed no signs of cardiac ischemia.  Her MIBI showed no evidence of scar or ischemia and an ejection fraction of 57%.  On the other hand, her blood sugars were found to be in the 300-400s.  Since then, she has been followed by the IM dept.  She comes in today complaining of 2 main symptoms that have been occuring for several months now, and which in large part led to her recent hospitalization: 1) dyspnea that occurs on average twice a week, allevaited after 30 min of SL NTG, no precipitating factors identified.  SOB not significantly imporved by albuterol.  2) neck pain, localized to the lateral aspects of her neck.  She feels ""her veins exploding"".  Of note, she suffered left ankle pain, for which she self-medicated cephalexin (without knowing its an Abx), which she had at home.  She says most of her symptoms resolved.  Per her husband, she has always been a fairly anxious person.  



ROS: No DOE, no PND, no fever.  Good apetite, polydypsia. Blurry vision.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  A total thyroidectomy, on levothyroxine 200 mcg daily, COPD, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, sleep apnea, cholecystectomy and a meniscal tear.

CV: JVP flat. RRR. 2/6 systolic murmur LUSB. no r/g. S1 + single S2.

Abd: Soft. Non-tender. Obese.

Extrem: Warm. 1+ non-pitting edema.





IMPRESSION:  Ms. Riley is a 66-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus, evidence of insulin resistance, most recent hemoglobin A1c was 9.4.  Her symptoms are quite vague and difficult to put together.  Importantly, myocardial ischemia has been ruled out by cardiac nucelar imaging.  My two main differentials are 1) general anxiety, 2) GERD.  Even though she does have a h/o COPD, but based on her history, physical exam and lack of efficacy of bronchodilators in releiveing her symptoms, I don't believe major underlying lung disease explans her symtoms.   We'll start her on klonopin 0.5 mg and fluoxetine 10 mg po qd.  Follow-up with LIMA psychiatry clinic for management of anxiety.



In terms of her glucose, she is improving, but still not adequately controlled.  She occasionally has blurry vision and is constantly thirsty.  Her next appointment is in January.  HBA1c yesterday=9.2, fasting glucose in the 200s.  Last increase in her insluin was in 11/30/69, from 80 U QAM to 90 U QPM.  For now, we'll increase her PM dose of insulin from 70 to 75 U SC QAM, and follow-up with her.. 







      

========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================

Discussed with Dr. Freddie Eric. 66 yo woman with poorly controlled DM. Recent admission for R/O MI. A1C was in the 9s. Being followed by Internal Medicine. Has odd sensation of numbness climbing from her toes to her chest associated with SOB and a sense that her neck is exploding. It would appear that she is having anxiety. We will treat with fluoxetine and Klonopin and refer to Psych. We will also adjust her insulin further.

She was last in the clinic on October 24, 2063.  She comes in today with her husband and daughter.  (Her daughter is her legal healthcare proxy.)  They come in to follow up on a recent hospitalization at Mid Coast Hospital.  In January, she was noted by her family to be agitated and confused.  She was missing her medication or taking too much medication at times, including her insulin.  She also became paranoid when efforts were made to intervene to assist her.  Her family notes that this seemed to begin after her gabapentin dose was increased to 600 mg bid.  She was also taking some other drugs at the time that affect the central nervous system, including trazodone, benzodiazepines, and narcotics for back pain.  She was admitted to the geriatric psychiatry unit at Mid Coast in January 2065.  She stayed there for almost a week.  According to the family, some medications were discontinued and donepazil was started.  Also, they think she had a brain MRI.  She improved and was ultimately discharged.  She has done much better since discharge.  She went with family to Michigan.  They report that there she was much better, playing water volleyball last week.  Her husband is now supervising her medications.  He still notices some memory loss, but this has improved since her discharge.  She has had frequent headaches.  She has noted no urinary incontinence and no worsening of her gait.


According to available notes, drugs stopped during her hospitalization include gabapentin, trazodone, metformin, HCTZ, Hunulin, and Lispro.  She is back no the metformin and HCTZ.


Her current medications are: aspirin 81 mg daily, Celebrex, donepazil 5 mg daily, HCTZ, linsinopril, labetalol, Crestor, insulin, pramipexole 0.125 mg qhs, Protonix, Roxicet, L-thyroxine, temazepam qhs, and metformin.  She is allergic to erythromycin.


On examination today pulse is 60 and regular.  BP is 104/60.  She is alert and oriented to time, except the precise date.  She is aware that yesterday was Tuesday.  She is oriented to place.  Her mental and motor responses are slightly slow.  She displays an appropriate sense of humor.  She attends well.  She recites the months of the year promptly forwards and backwards. She registers 4 of 4 words.  She recalls 3/4 at one minutes and the 4th with a semantic clue with a slight error ""14 Massachusetts Drive"" rather than 24 Massachusetts Drive.  At 5 minutes, she recalls all 4 with only the error, ""14 Massachusetts Drive"" but with no need for a clue.  At 10 minutes, she recalls 2/4 without any clue, the 3rd with a semantic hint, and the 4th with a semantic hint again as ""14 Massachusetts Drive.""  She readily adds a simple sum in her head.  She follows multiple step commands.  She copies interlocking pentagons and a 3D cube well with only slight 3D perspective distortion.  She constructs a clock well with good planning and no neglect.  


Visual fields are full.  Pupils are 2.5 mm and reactive.  Fundi are not well visualized.  There rest of the cranial nerves are intact.  Muscle bulk, tone, and power are normal.  There are not extrapyramidal features, and there is no paratonia.  Reflexes are damp in the arms and absent at the ankles (UE 1/4, knees 2/4, ankles 0/4) and symmetric.  Plantar responses are flexor.  Romberg is negative.  She walks without hesitation in gait initiation.  Her stride is reasonably good,  Her base is only slightly widened.  She tandem walks with moderate unsteadiness.  


The examination has not changed much from her visit in October 2063.  She has some problems with memory by examination, but this seems to have improved greatly since her hospitalization.  Her confusion and reported paranoia seem to have gone away. Except or mild psychomotor slowing, she does not have features to suggest NPH as the cause, such as urinary incontinence or magnetic gait.  I suspect that her recent deterioration was due to adverse reaction to psychoactive medication that has now been discontinued of limited.


We will make no change in medication today.  We will request the recent MRI from Mid Coast.  She will return in several weeks after we have gotten the MRI.

Dear Vernon,

I write to summarize for your records the recent IMC course of your patient, Dr. Alec Gipson, who was admitted to our cardiology service on 07/25/2060 with progressive angina and a small, non-ST elevation MI.  His cardiac troponin rose to 0.13.  There were no demonstrable ECG changes, though we queried the possibility of a left circumflex event.  He had been previously scheduled for semi-urgent catheterization and angiography on 07/26/2060.

His condition stabilized with institution of anti-thrombotic and anti-ischemic therapy.  He was taken to the catheterization laboratory by Dr. Otero on 07/26/2060.  Angiography demonstrated a high-grade lesion in the proximal portion of a large first diagonal branch, as well as a significant stenosis in the first obtuse marginal branch.  The diagonal lesion was managed with angioplasty and deployment of a drug-eluting stent.  A drug-eluting stent could not be delivered to the obtuse marginal lesion; a bare-metal stent was positioned without difficulty.  He did have smoldering chest discomfort of an anginal nature following the procedure.  The cardiac troponin elevated further to a peak value of 0.86 as of 07/27/2060 (08:54).  He also had a mild, vagal reaction characterized by flushing and transient bradycardia.

He felt much improved the following day.  A repeat cardiac troponin returned at a lower level of 0.75.  An abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of an AAA.  After consultation with you, we felt that he could return home, under the care of his wife.

He was discharged on the afternoon of 07/27/2060.  His medications included Ecotrin 325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, losartan 100 mg daily, metformin 500 mg b.i.d., Toprol-XL 50 mg b.i.d., niacin 500 mg b.i.d., ramipril 2.5 mg daily, and nitroglycerin if needed.

Please let me know if I can provide you with any further information.

Sincerely yours,

Reason for visit:

   Follow up: NSVT and history of VF Arrest



Interval History:

   Mr. Quijano returned for follow-up today. His last visit was in December 2075, following which he had a routine stress test. He had been planning to do some skiing over January, and we wanted to give him clearance to do so.



His stress test was done on 1-4-76, and revealed mild apical ischemia. He completed 8 METs and had no symptoms during the test.  Based on these findings, we did not change any medications and encouraged him to continue with his usual activities.  Unfortunatley, he was never able to ski over January anyway due to a bout with pneumonia.



He had also reported a vague sensation of shortness of breath that was occurring ""rarely"", but was correlated with the consumption of alcohol.  The frequency of these episodes has increased to 2-3 times per week. He says it is not really shortness of breath, but an awareness that something feels different. He is able to continue his usual activities, including his aerobics and pilates classes without difficulty.



He denies any chest discomfort, palpitations, rapid heart action, dizziness or syncope.



Past medical history:

Medications (Confirmed):



			

Dalmane 30 mg

glyburide 2.5mg po qd

Lipitor 20 mg

Physical examination:

-BP: 110/70  

-Pulse: 50  

-General:   No acute distress.

-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.

-Heent:   Unremarkable

-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP no jugular venous distention.

-Chest:   Clear to auscultation.

-Cardiac:   Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 or S4. There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.

-Extremities:   No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ pedal pulses.



EKG:

   Sinus Bradycardia 50bpm, 1st degree AV block PR 290ms, RBBB. Compared to previous EKGs, PR interval is slightly longer.



Assessment and plan:

   Mr. Quijanno is doing well with the exception of these brief episodes of shortness of breath. I am encouraged that these events do not inhibit him from exercise. We have fitted him with a holter monitor today to further sort out any arrhythmogenic etiology of his symptoms.  We will discuss the findings over the phone on Wednesday of this week.



The above plan was discussed with Dr. Kilian Middleton, who is in agreement.

Visit Note


Patient Name: JUSTUS, QUIANA                       MRN: 9814048
Dictated Date: 07/27/2091                      Dictated By: Ida Xayachack, M.D.


Date of Visit: 07/24/2091




The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease who comes in today for followup. Please see the recent note from cardiology from 06/27/2091. She is status post stenting in 03/2091 and 06/2091. Post her second procedure she also had a large hematoma which has been gradually resolving. 


She has type 2 diabetes and her fasting sugars have been very well controlled. She is currently on metformin 1000 mg b.i.d. and glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. She is trying to watch her diet and salt intake. She has not had any symptoms of hypoglycemia. She had lost some weight after her first heart attack but her weight has been stable. 


Her lisinopril was recently increased by cardiology. She has no exertional chest pain, PND, orthopnea, edema, or claudication. 


She has a history of iron deficiency anemia and had refused colonoscopies in the past. At the time of her heart attack she had been intubated and had some coffee grounds noted and also required a blood transfusion. She has not noted any epigastric pain, abdominal pain, melena, or hematochezia. She does take her iron supplements and her stools are dark on the iron supplements. I had discussed with patient and daughter several times that she should get a colonoscopy to evaluate her guaiac iron deficiency anemia but she continues to refuse one. 


Also noted on her admissions was that she had a lung nodule and possible pancreatic mass on CT from 03/2091 and 06/2091. She should get a repeat CT in 12/2091. 


She is not having any abdominal pain. 


She has chronic back pain and osteoarthritis pain. Of note she also had elevated parathyroid levels in the past but refuses to see Endocrinology either in Fayetteville or at United Methodist Behavioral Hospital. 


Please see her medication list which was reviewed with the patient and her daughter. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is in no acute distress. Blood pressure 132/70. Neck: Supple without JVD or bruits. Lungs: Clear without wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1 and S2. No S3, S4 or bruits. Abdomen: Mildly obese, soft, nontender. She still has some residual hematoma near her right groin. She has a left femoral artery bruit. The hematoma has significantly decreased in size compared to prior visit. No CCE. Distal pulses intact. 


1. Coronary artery disease. She has no symptoms of decompensated heart failure on her current regimen. Her blood pressure is well controlled with the recent increase in the lisinopril from 20 to 40 mg daily. Check Chem-7. 


Hypomagnesemia. Check followup magnesium level. 


Type 2 diabetes. Her last hemoglobin A1c was 6.1 which is excellent. Continue current medications. 
Iron deficiency anemia. She should have a colonoscopy +/- an upper endoscopy but she declines these procedures. She is aware that we have not ruled out colon cancer or adenomatous colonic polyps or other cause for her iron deficiency anemia. Check CBC. 


History of lung nodule and possible pancreatic mass versus IPMN. These were both stable on imaging from 03/2091 and 06/2091. She needs repeat imaging in 6 months. She will follow up with me in 10/2091 so we can get a flu shot and schedule these procedures.

Major Problems





Hand pain

The patient has been treated with Indocin and had resolution of his wrist swelling and pain, suggesting gout.  

A: Stable. 

P: Indocin PRN.  We will check renal function today.



Claudication

The patient does not complain of pain today.  He has vascular disease and Dr.  Rico as well as our renal consultants were in contract about the optimal management and the worry of his renal artery stenosis.  I have referred him back to Renal where he has not been seen in many months.



Coronary artery disease

There are no new symptoms.  He had chest pain and an admission to Colonial Manor several months ago.  There, an adenosine MIBI showed inferior scar and no reversible ischemia.  Cardiac function was 67%.  There was diffuse contraction thickening of the walls.



Diabetes mellitus

The patient remains on metformin, and hemoglobin A1c will be rechecked.



Hypertension

The patient remains on a complex regimen with the assistance of the Renal Service.  He remains on hydralazine, atenolol, Cozaar, and Norvasc.  His blood pressure has been stable by his report, and we get 150/80, repeated by me 150/70 today.  

A: Metastable hypertension. 

P: Follow up Renal Service and check BUN and creatinine today.



Renal failure

Has proteinuria and a creatinine approaching 3.  I have asked him to reschedule a followup with the Renal Service.

HPI: Kadeem Vicente comes in today for a follow-up office visit.  The 
patient was seen by me approximately one month ago as a new patient and 
whose primary medical concerns a history of coronary artery disease, for 
which he suffered a ""silent heart attack"" many years ago, a history of 
benign prostatic hypertrophy, as well as hypertension and GERD.  As it 
turns out, the patient had been on Zantac for many, many years, the 
beneficial effects of which were unknown.  We had decided as of our last 
meeting to stop this drug and find out if he became symptomatic.  The 
patient reports today that he is not symptomatic, and thus we will 
continue to discontinue this medicine.  At this point, the patient does 
not need the addition of a proton pump inhibitor, such as Prilosec.  
With regard to the patient's symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, 
the patient said that he only has taken one dose of the Hytrin, since he 
wanted to use up all his Minipress, which he tool up until 2 nights ago.  
Thus it is too early to assess the efficacy of this medication.  It is 
noted that his blood pressure was 152/74, which is better than it was 
the last time he was here, which the systolic range was 160-170 and 
diastolic was 80-90.  The patient reports no new symptomatology other 
than occasional fatigue, from which he will have to rest.  The patient 
has no symptoms of congestive heart failure, no shortness of breath, no 
ankle edema, no JVD by observation, and his laboratory results are 
remarkably normal, given his medical complaints.  The patient's 
cholesterol is 190 with a slightly above average triglycerides.  Review 
of systems otherwise negative.
 
Physical exam is not performed at this time.  Blood pressure was 152/76 
on the right, 152/76 on the left, temperature was 96.8, respirations 20 
and unlabored, and pulse was 70.
 
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a 75 year old man with multiple medical 
problems coming in for follow-up.
1.   Hypertension - the patient will stay on his Zestril and will use 
     Hytrin now, both for his hypertension, as well as benign prostatic 
     hypertrophy.  The patient does speak of some nocturnal dribbling, 
     and he said he also has urge incontinence, particularly while 
     standing.  The patient was told that after a trial of Hytrin, which 
     hopefully can help with his symptoms of benign prostatic 
     hypertrophy, that this urge incontinency will also be helped.  If 
     the patient's symptoms continue beyond this, he will be referred to 
     Urology for possible TUNA procedure.
 
2.   BPH - please see above.  The patient will stay on Hytrin for now.
 
3.   ? coronary artery disease - the patient's cholesterol is 190 with a 
     slightly above average triglycerides, which is more than acceptable 
     for this gentleman.  I do not have an HDL in which to judge his 
     ratio, but I was by the patient before that it runs in the high 40s

     or low 50s.  Therefore this will be an acceptable ratio without 
     therapy.  I will get a fasting lipid on the patient probably in 
     about 6 months, and if there is any derangement in his profile, he 
     will be put on an antilipid drug.
 
4.   GI - at this point his GERD symptoms have not returned, and what I 
     will attempt to do is to keep him off his H2 blockers at this 
     point.  Should his symptoms return, the patient most likely will be 
     placed on Prilosec.
 
I will seen him in one month for follow-up, primarily for evaluation of 
his use of Hytrin.

Name:  Xochilt Vuong

MRN:  6398353





REASON FOR VISIT:  Xochilt Vuong is a 74-year-old patient of Dr. Wanda Yeomans, and is sent because of rising serum creatinine.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Vuong has a history of diabetes mellitus 

going back more than 10 years.  She also has had hypertension and elevated lipids 

over approximately the same period of time.  She has a complicated history 

including lung cancer and colon cancer, both treated and in remission.  Her 

creatinine has been rising gradually over recent years with a value of 1.0 in 2062, 

1.2 in May 2063, 2.1 and 1.8 in early 2064 with 2.3 in May 2064, and recently 3.1 

obtained on July 06, 2064.



She has been quite anemic in the recent months with a hematocrit level of 24.9.  

Her serum folate, B12, and iron and are not particularly low, and MCV is normal 

at 81.  Urinalysis showed 3+ albumin in September 2062 and persisting 

proteinuria since that time.  Dr. Yeomans obtained an ultrasound examination in 

March, which showed diffusely thinned renal cortices, but no evidence of 

obstruction, stones, or masses.



She has visited an ophthalmologist regularly for macular degeneration.  She does 

not know whether signs of diabetes are present, but she has had no laser treatment 

for any proliferative retinopathy.



Recently, she has been feeling unusually fatigued with diminished appetite and 

almost constant nausea.  She vomits rarely.  Her weight has fallen by about 20 

pounds.  She is slightly constipated.  She is moderately dyspneic on exertion.  She 

is not troubled by muscle cramps or by unusual itching of her skin.



Her medications continue as listed with ACE inhibitors, ""statins,"" and a rather 

large dose of Lasix at 80 mg twice a day.



Medications

Synthroid 0.05 MG PO 1 TAB QD

Lopressor (METOPROLOL Tartrate) 50MG, 0.5 Tablet(s) PO BID

Fe Gluconate (FERROUS Gluconate) 325MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO TID

Prilosec (OMEPRAZOLE) 20MG, 1 Capsule(s) PO BID

Lipitor 40 MG PO 1 TAB QD 





PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, she looks tired but 

reasonably comfortable.  She speaks in a high-pitched somewhat hoarse voice, 

which has persisted since one of her surgical procedures.  Her blood pressure in 

the right arm, sitting, is 148/60 with regular pulse 72.  Her chest has a few basal 

crackles but in general is clear and air moves comfortably.  JVP fills below the 

sternal angle heart shows a grade 2 systolic murmur, loudest at the upper left 

sternal border.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  There is no renal tenderness.  

Extremities have no edema.



IMPRESSION:  Progressive renal failure in a 74-year-old woman with more than 

10 years' history of diabetes as well has hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  The 

proteinuria, if confirmed, would support the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy but 

this would be unusual in the absence of retinopathy.  It would be useful to know 

from her ophthalmologist whether retinopathy is present.  It is, of course, also 

possible that she has vascular disease involving the kidneys.  Their symmetry and 

the presence of proteinuria would argue against this possibility.  The ACE 

inhibitor in the presence of vascular disease might of course raise her serum 

creatinine by reducing renal blood flow somewhat.  Her loss of appetite and 

nausea may well be related to the degree of renal failure.



RECOMMENDATION:  I would suggest that she see Filomena Xia, RD, a renal 

dietitian, to learn a diet appropriate for renal failure as well as for her diabetes and 

hyperlipidemia.  This might succeed in reducing some of her nausea.  It think it 

would be worthwhile as an experiment to reduce or discontinue her Accupril and 

perhaps  her Lasix temporarily to see whether serum creatinine falls with 

less ACE inhibition and somewhat more fluid volume.  If, of course, shortness of 

breath worsens or edema appears, then returning to the Lasix would be 

reasonable.  It might be that a longer acting, milder diuretic, such as 5 mg of 

metolazone might help to control edema (and potassium) and reduce the 

requirement for Lasix.  If serum creatinine fell appreciably with less ACE and 

diuresis, it would reassure us that the damage was not all structural, and it might 

be then possible to return to these medicines with less worry.



Her anemia is no doubt related to lack of erythropoietin and would likely benefit 

from instituting therapy with Epogen (such as 4000 units twice a week) or 

Aranesp).



PLAN:  We will send a urine today for total protein to creatinine ratio, which may 

help us decide whether the problem is mainly diabetic nephropathy.  If so, the 

measures proposed would be appropriate.  We discussed the eventual probable 

need for dialysis (assuming no other intercurrent medical catastrophes).  It would 

be useful for her to visit the DCGH Renal Department (located here on our 

floor at 592G, along with Ms. Xia's office) to learn about modes of dialysis.  

We discussed construction of a forearm fistula, which should be done well before 

a need for it arises.  I would, in fact, recommend that she proceed to have this 

done in the next few months.  This could be arranged through Dr. Xaysana's office 

or perhaps by speaking with Dr. Najee Yuan.  I will, of course, help with any of 

these measures as necessary.









Xander Xie, M.D.





Wanda

Urine total protein/creatinine ratio is only 0.11 (corresponding to about 0.1 g/day or proteinuria).  This is a very small amount for diabetic nephropathy, and argues in favor of vascular disease.  I would suggest getting a MRA of renal arteries to look for any main artery obstruction.  If present it would account for the sensitivity of her creatinine to ACE or changes in hydration.

Visit Note



Patient Name: RICO, NATHAN C                     

MRN: 9190908

Dictated Date: 11/23/2071                    

Dictated By: Leroy Kelly

Date of Visit: 11/23/2071



Nathan was seen today in routine followup with Clinic Attending Dr. Kim Mays who concurs with the assessment plan that I will outline below.



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Nathan is a 51-year-old, right-handed man who suffered a large right MCA territory stroke in October 2069.  This occurred in the setting of right internal carotid artery occlusion, and hemicraniectomy was required for management of malignant cerebral edema after the stroke.  He subsequently developed an infection of the abdominal bone flap.  His stroke workup revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor.  A hypercoagulability panel was negative.  Homocysteine was normal.  Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.  His recovery was complicated by brain abscess, which required surgical drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy.  Finally an artificial bone flap was replaced in October 2070.  He then developed persistent nausea and vomiting and a pseudomeningocele.  A VP shunt was placed by Dr. Bennett.  Unfortunately, even after shunting there was persistent nausea and vomiting.  This turned out to be a side effect of Fentanyl patch use.  The Fentanyl was subsequently replaced with methadone for chronic left-sided neuropathic pain, and the nausea and vomiting abated.



I last saw Nathan on April 2nd of this year at which point he was doing quite well.  He complained of some hot flashes of unclear etiology.  His depression seemed to be under better control on Celexa. 



Today he reports that he continues to have trouble with neuropathic pain on the left side of his body.  Fortunately he has managed to wean himself off of methadone and this has not caused the pain to get any worse.  He is using a substantial dose of Neurontin, which he thinks is helpful.  He complains that these pains involve his face, arm, and leg on the left side and he wonders whether there might be some relationship between the pain and the shunt, which was placed on the left side of his head.  He also complains of occasional leg spasms at night, which are not particularly bothersome.  His most significant complaint at this time relates to the hot flashes that he mentioned at our last visit.  These often occur several times daily, although they may not occur for several days at a time.  He explains that most of the episodes occur when he is in bed at night.  He first develops a feeling of nausea followed by a cold sensation on one side of his body or the other.  This has been followed by a feeling of heat from the top of his head down to his toes.  There may be a feeling of urinary urgency.  He then experiences a sensation as if he is floating on the bed, and generally this is followed by nausea.  The entire episode lasts only seconds but the nausea may persist for as long as an hour.  He also notes on some mornings he does not feel like getting out of bed.  He continues to experience depressed mood, and he longs to return to a normal state of functioning.  



He has returned to volunteering as a Big Brother.  He is unable to work.  His divorce is now complete and he is really glad about this.  He is living with a friend named Tejeda who takes excellent care of him.  



His left arm remains paralyzed.  He has minimal proximal strength in his leg.  He has a dense visual field deficit on the left side.  



He has one new complaint which is a feeling of numbness and tingling in the 4th and 5th fingers on the right side.  



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY include diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.  



CURRENT MEDICATIONS include Celexa 20 mg daily, Neurontin 600 mg q.i.d., Phenergan p.r.n., Avandia, Glucophage, Lopressor, Zestril, Pravachol, insulin, and aspirin 325 mg daily.  



On exam Nathan is well-appearing.  His hair has now grown back.  On mental status exam he is able to relate a cogent history.  He has a number of questions about stroke rehabilitation possibilities including a hyperbaric oxygen program that he learned about in Connecticut.  Eye contact is good.  On cranial nerve exam pupils are round and reactive and extraocular movements are intact.  There is a left visual field deficit.  The face is asymmetric with an upper motor neuron pattern left facial droop.  The tongue protrudes in the midline.  The left arm is completely plegic.  The left leg has greater than anti-gravity proximal strength.  There is left-sided sensory extinction.  Reflexes are brisk on the left and normal on the right.  Nathan is able to ambulate with a cane and a left ankle foot orthosis.  



We spent much of today's visit discussing various issues that concern Nathan.  Regarding the possibility of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for stroke rehabilitation.  I explained that there is no convincing evidence in favor of this approach.  There are some risks to hyperbaric oxygen therapy such as lung injury and the programs are extremely costly.  Therefore I advised Nathan not to pursue that option.



Regarding his frequent hot flashes, which are very bothersome, the etiology of these episodes is quite unclear.  Dr. Mays mentioned the possibility that these episodes represent some sort of diencephalic paroxysmal discharges.  I think it is possible that these are a side effect of Celexa; I believe that they first occurred shortly after starting Celexa.  We decided to stop the Celexa for a 2-week period to see if there is any improvement in the episodes.  If there is, I would consider changing to an antidepressant that works by a different mechanism.  If there is no change in the episodes we can go ahead and add Celexa back.  



I neglected to mention above that there is sensory loss to temperature and pinprick in the right hand involving the 4th and 5th digits and the ulnar aspect of the hand on the palmar surface.  There is no motor dysfunction in the hand.  There is no Tinel's sign over the ulnar nerve at the elbow.  The ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove is not hypermobile.  The symptoms and physical exam are consistent with ulnar entrapment neuropathy, which I suspect is the result of arm flexion during sleep.  I suggested that Nathan buy an elbow pad with a Velcro strap that will help facilitate keeping the arm straight during sleep.  We will keep an eye on this over time.  



No other changes are indicated at the moment.  I intend to see Nathan in followup in about 6 months.

	Interval History:

   Cardiologist:  Hall



Mr. Innis is a 77 y/o man with h/o CAD s/p LAD stenting (Taxus Express 3.0x16mm) in 3/95.  All other vessels had only minimal irregularities.  Since that time, he has had only mild chest discomfort which is always relieved with nitroglycerin.  



This morning, he had a more severe episode of chest pain accompanied by SOB and diaphoresis that started when walking to the dock after starting his boat.  The pain was primarily in his back, similar to his angina prior to stenting.  The pain lasted for approximately 30 min despite SL NTG, although did go away eventually.  He had diaphoresis, SOB, and blurred vision associated with the pain.  He was brought to the ED by his family.  On arrival, he was pain free. P 60 BP 110/70.  He was treated with ASA and Lopressor.  EKG was unremarkable.  Two sets of markers were negative.  He is admitted to complete rule out MI and further diagnostic testing.



He currently denies pain and feels back to his baseline.  He denies orthopnea, PND, LE swelling, + occasional palpitations, no syncope/near syncope.

RE: EGAN, VAL
MRN: 8268084
DOB: 07/30/2063


Dear Dr. Rucker, 


I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Val in the office today. As you recall, he is a very pleasant 71-year-old gentleman with a history of right-sided trigeminal neuralgia. He has pain behind the right eye that has been present for 3 years. He describes it as a very sharp, severe, stabbing pain. He takes Tegretol, which helps but does not completely alleviate the pain. Over the past month the pain has become worse and increasingly intolerable. He has increased his Tegretol dose to 800 mg per day, which is about the limit of what he can tolerate. 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes, asthma. 


MEDICATIONS: Levothyroxine, Lyrica, Tegretol, glyburide and metformin. 


ALLERGIES: None. 


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Cholecystectomy. 


SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is retired, a laboratory technician and lives in cincinnati.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Noncontributory. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pleasant, older man in mild distress secondary to the pain. His mental status, cranial nerve examination, strength and sensation were normal. 


IMPRESSION AND PLAN: In summary, this is a patient with what seems to be right V1 trigeminal neuralgia. The fact that he responded to the Tegretol is encouraging. I discussed the different options with him including no surgery, radiofrequency rhizotomy, and microvascular decompression. He elected to proceed with a microvascular decompression. I discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient and all his questions were answered. A surgical consent was obtained. The plan is to perform the surgery on 08/31/2135. Prior to proceeding, I would like to obtain a dedicated brain MRI with fine cuts through the posterior fossa to better assess the neurovascular anatomy. 


I thank you very much and look forward to hearing from you in the future.

HPI: Pt is a 56 yo woman with a PMH significant for multiple cardiac risk factors, including IDDM, with a HbA1C of 10.7 earlier this month, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, whose insulin dose was increased 3 weeks ago.  Her blood sugars have subsequently been low, reaching the 50s on several occasions.  At these times, she experiences diaphoresis and dizziness.  The pt took her morning insulin as usual, ate her normal breakfast, and at 4:30pm was walking to the kitchen when she got dizzy and felt her legs    turn to jelly.     She felt herself falling, yelled out to her son and landed on her left arm.  She lost consciousness.  Her son found her unresponsive and witnessed her vomit twice, drool, mumble and lose bladder continence.  She regained consciousness a few minutes later and was placed in an ambulance, where her BS was found to be 91.  She was brought to the DDCH ED, where plain films showed a fractured left humerus and a head CT was negative for bleed.     



She denies CP, SOB or palpitations.  At baseline, the pt is able to walk one mile and climb three flights of stairs without SOB or CP.

Plan:

Syncope- most likely etiology hypoglycemic seizure.  Given pt's markedly elevated HbA1C, blood sugars likely very high chronically.  Now with tight glycemic control, including blood sugars in the 50s, pt likely seized.  Other worrisome etiologies would include cardiac- has multiple risk factors, but no data supporting CAD (enzymes negative, ECG no change, no signs/symptoms of CHF, no valvular disease, no history of arrhythmias)  Will continue rule out MI.  Don't think TTE necessary.  Also, could be cerebrovascular disease, although imaging of cerebral vasculature has been mostly normal.  Head CT negative for bleed.  Will discuss EEG with pt's neurologist in am.



Left humerus fracture- reduction by ortho in ED.  Pt should sleep in upright position (per ortho).  Percocet for pain control.

CCU Admission Note
Patient Name: Justus, Quiana
MR# 9814048
Location: Internal Medicine
PCP: Xayachack, Ida, M.D.
Date of Admission: 3/18/91
CC: STEMI


HPI: 
79 yo lady with DM, HTN, HL who presented with new onset chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have lateral STEMI. It began last Sunday, when she noticed the new onset of back pain, which progressed and was associated with shortness of breath by Monday. She apparently called EMS on Tuesday then and en route she had a long run of VT, which responded to 50mg of Lidocaine IV. She was intubated on arrival in the ED for progressive respiratory distress. ECG showed lateral ST elevations and a CT scan of her chest was negative for any signs of aortic dissection. Of note, she was also noticed to have elevated blood sugars in the 500s in the ED with an AG of 20, that came down to 16. 


On immediate LHC, a 100% occlusion of her OM1 was found and recannalized as well as stented with a Vision BMS, resulting in TIMI 2 flow. Her LAD was found to be patent but and her RCA showed diffuse atherosclerosis up to 60% stenosis at most. LV ventriculogram showed inferior hypokinesis with moderate MR.  An IABP was placed with her initial augmented diastolic pressures recorded in the 80s, which led to the initiation of Levophed, Dobutamine and Dopamine.


A PAC was placed in the cath lab as well with her initial Wedge reported as 19-20,  PAPs in the 50s.


On transfer to the CCU, she was intubated, sedated, being on IV Levophed at 20/hr, Dobutamine at 200/hr and Dopamine at 300/hr. Her CO was recorded as 6.0, her CI 3.5 with an initial SVR of 1012. Her Temp. was 96.1, HR 115 bpm, augmented diastolic BP of 124, which subsequently ranged between 70 and 100 on the day of her admission. She spiked a temperature up to 101 on the evening of admission after she received a dose of Levaquin IV in the setting of a rising WBC up to 40K. Vasopressin was added IV, which provided further support of her MAP. Intermittent NS fluid boluses helped to bring her HR down per RN and supported her MAPs with her PAD ranging between 18-24 and a urine output between 30 and 100 cc/hr. When her CI dropped to 1.9 around 9.30 pm with an increased SVR of 1550, the cardiac fellow was called and the decision was made to wean her Levophed as tolerated, which was then brought down to 16/hr with her Dopamine having been weaned off and continued Dobutamine and Vasopressin. The patient was also maintained on Reopro and Heparin IV for her STEMI.

Hypertension
DM type 2
Hyperlipidemia
Iron deficiency anemia with pt refusing colonoscopy for several months
DJD of hands - involving PIP's, DIP's, 1st CMC's.

Bilateral somewhat symmetric perihilar airspace opacities both lungs.  This could be edema or pneumonia. No large pleural effusions or pneumothoraces. Interval placement of the due left lower lobe monitor line below. Endotracheal tube and 4.6 cm.  NG tube to stomach.


CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis &#8211; AD protocol:
No evidence of aortic dissection, narrowed SMA at its origin. Bilateral consolidation in the dependent portions of the upper and lower lobes, consistent with aspiration and/or pneumonia. Interlobular septal thickening and small bilateral pleural effusions, consistent with pulmonary edema. Indeterminate hypodense lesion in the body of the pancreas. Differential considerations include a cyst and IPMN. Bilateral renal hypodensities, the largest of which are consistent with simple cysts. Heterogeneous thyroid gland, with areas of hypodensity.
 
Bedside TTE: no evidence of papillary muscle rupture, moderate MR present

Repeat EKG 9 hours after CCU Admission: NSR at 99 , RBBB, left posterior fascicular block, 3-4 mm STE in V4-V6, II,III, AvF resolving.


Impression:
79 yo lady with DM, HTN, HL who presented with lateral STEMI with occluded OM1, s/p BM stent and is now in cardiogenic and septic shock.


Plan: 
1.        CV Pump: cardiogenic shock: continue vasopressor and inotrope support with Dobutamine, Levophed, Vasopressin, goal to wean Levophed to reduce afterload and increase CI, continue to give fluid boluses intermittently as she appeared preload dependent possibly due to RV involvement, MAP goal above 65, goal to keep CI above 2.2, f/u urine output with goal to keep above 25, trending lactic acid
2.        CV Ischemia: STEMI, cont. ASA, Plavix, Heparin, Reopro, holding BB and ACE in setting of hypotension, will check HbA1c
3.        CV Rhythm: currently NSR, on Tele
4.        Septic shock: aspiration event vs. possibly CAP, no evidence of other infectious source, covering empirically with Vancomycin/Levaquin IV given absence of recent hospitalization over the past 90 days, checking C.diff, will have low threshold to broaden coverage further if necessary
5.        HTN: currently hypotensive, holding BP meds
6.        DM: holding Metformin, RISS
7.        FEN: NPO for now with NGT on continous suctioning

Impression

My impression is that her type 2 diabetes requires basal insulin administration while she is NPO and on iv D5W. She should have regular insulin for coverage q 6 hours rather than Novolog while NPO because this will provide 'smoother"" coverage



Recommendation

My recommendations are:

1.Please administer NPH 20 units q 12 hours while NPO

2.Change ss to regular insulin q6hours while NPO

3.When taking po and iv D5W has been stopped start Novolog 5 units plus scale pre-meals( liquids to start) and dc regular insulin scale

This patient was seen with resident, Dr. Elmore.  Resident's

note was reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined by me, and

I confirm the resident's findings.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, Ms. Kimbrough is a

46-year-old woman with history of hypothyroidism, anxiety,

diabetes, and nephrotic syndrome.  She is also dialysis

dependent.  Her last dialysis was yesterday, she developed acute

onset chest pressure with severe shortness of breath and

diaphoresis while at home.  Called EMS and was brought to the

Emergency Department.  The patient is unable to give a full

history and at this time secondary to her significant respiratory

distress.  Please review resident's note for full details of

obtainable past medical history, social history, review of

systems, medications, and allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I confirm the physical exam is as

documented.  The patient is awake in severe respiratory distress.

 Pulse is 126, respirations 40, blood pressure is initially noted

at 253/129, and oximetry is 92% on facemask.  Physical exam

reveals a diaphoretic woman who is breathing rapidly with

accessory muscle use, nasal flaring and tripoding.  She has rales

halfway up bilaterally with inspiratory and expiratory wheezes. 

Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia.  Abdomen is obese but soft. 

Extremity exam reveals bilateral 3+ edema up to the knees. 

Rectal exam reveals trace heme-positive stool that is brown.

On route, the patient received multiple doses of sublingual

nitroglycerin as well as IV Lasix.  She is known to make urine, a

Foley catheter was placed immediately.  IV access was

established, and the patient received large doses of diuretics. 

Was immediately started on IV nitroglycerin and a BiPAP.  On

BiPAP, the patient's oxygenation was 100%.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs were obtained, which showed a hematocrit

of 36, and BUN and creatinine of 15 and 5.1.  BNP was noted at

700.  Cardiac enzymes:  CK was 334, CK-MB 4.9, and troponin was

less than assay.  However, labs were obtained within half an hour

of her symptoms starting, magnesium was low at 1.6.  Urinalysis

was negative and urine HCG was negative.  EKG was sinus

tachycardia without any ST or T-wave changes concerning for

rate-related ischemia.  There were no prior EKGs available. 

Chest x-ray showed bilateral CHF.  The Nephrology fellow covering

hemodialysis was notified that the patient would need immediate

hemodialysis and this was scheduled for 6:00 a.m.

DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease, hemodialysis dependent, and

CHF.

ASSESSMENT:  Given the patient's constellation of symptoms, it is

likely that she had an ischemic event that caused flash pulmonary

edema and subsequent symptomatology.  Given the current regimen,

in the Emergency Department, the patient gradually improved.  The

respiratory rate was noted at 23.  Her heart rate came down to

113 and blood pressure was well controlled on the IV

nitroglycerin noted finally at 140/77.  The patient was taken to

hemodialysis at 7:45 and admitted to the hospital thereafter for

CC:  HTN and SOB


HPI: 
Ms. Iot is a 69-year-old female with a history of CHF (EF 40%, no home O2), DM type 2, HTN, nephrotic syndrome, and 1/8/2075 R humerus ORIF presenting from Crest Nursing Home with SOB and HTN. She was discharged from NGH to rehab on 1/8/2075 after ORIF of a right humeral fracture. She feels that she has been doing fairly at rehab. On the evening prior to admission, however, she had some anxiety that resolved after receiving Ativan from her nurse. She then was able to fall asleep but woke-up at 2AM with diaphoresis and SOB. She denied chest pain. She was attended to and her BP was 220/117. She was given 2 SL NTG, O2, and Lasix, after which her SOB somewhat improved but her HTN continued. She also complains of a chronic cough that is productive of white/yellow sputum. She denies missed medications, changes in diet, adding salt to meals (although she is at rehab and her diet order is unclear). At this time, she denies CP, SOB. 


ED COURSE:  
Vitals upon arrival to the ED were T 98.9   HR 114  BP 225/125 RR 32  02 Sat  84% RA. Exam was notable for tachycardia, rales at the apices, use of accessory muscles, and LE edema. Labs were notable for elevated WBC and BNP, non-infected U/A, and evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR. She received Lasix 40mg IV X2, nitoglycerin,  Nitropaste,ASA 81mg, Metformin 500, Simvastatin 40, Losartan 50, Lisinopril 40, Prozac 20, Calcium carbonate, and Lopressor 25.  She produced 700 cc urine. Upon d/c from the ED, BP was 157/72 and O2 sat was 100% on 2L. LENIs were pending.

MICROBIOLOGY: None


RADIOLOGY
1. CXR: Lungs:  The lungs are satisfactorily inflated. There is increasing
prominence of the interstitium and peribronchial cuffing when compared to the prior study consistent with interval development of CHF.  Surgical clips are again noted projected over the left lower hemithorax.  No definite focal consolidation is demonstrated. Pleura:  There is no pneumothorax. The hemidiaphragms are very slightly less distinct than on the comparison study.  This could be related to the onset of parenchymal changes of CHF, but could also be related to a small amount of pleural fluid. IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with CHF.


2. Bilateral LENIs: NO EVIDENCE OF FEMORAL OR POPLITEAL DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS OF
EITHER LEG.


EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at 95. Normal axis. Normal PR, QRS, QT intervals. No ST elevations or depressions.  ? Q waves in v1, v2, v3 but also may be upslopes before the downslops. However new since 12/12/2074




ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN


Mrs. Ito is a 69F with a history of CHF (EF 40%, no home O2), DM type 2, HTN, nephritic syndrome, and 1/15/2075 R humerus ORIF presenting from Crest Nursing Home with SOB and HTN. Her exam and imaging is consistent with pulmonary edema, as she has had in the past. The precipitant of her flash pulmonary edema is less clear, however. She describes waking up acutely short of breath and was found to be profoundly hypertensive. It is possible that HTN 2/2 a change in her diet or fluid intake at rehab, ischemia, increases renin-aldo, or other cause led to flash pulmonary edema.  Conversely, however, CHF may have precipitated her HTN.
 
1. Shortness of breath/CHF: Evidence of volume overload by exam and imaging. PE also on the differential but seems less likely given improvement of resp status, negative LENIs. 
-- Lasix 40mg IV now 
-- Strict I+O
-- Daily weights
-- F/up PA/Lat
-- Continuous O2 sat monitor;Telemetry, cardiac monitor
-- f/up cardiac enzymes
-- ASA 325 qd
-- Will give Lopressor 25 Q8 and Captopril 50 Q8 for now but may need to reconsider the BB if CHF less compensated. 
-- Albuterol and atrovent for possible COPD component given tobacco history
-- Consider TTE in AM
-- Consider PFTs


2. Leukocytosis: Infection vs stress response. Patient presents with elevated WBC with 80% polys. Infectious work-up has included U/A that is negative for infection. CXR does not show evidence of focal consolidation, however may be obscured by pulmonary edema. Mental status at baseline. I am suspicious for PNA given her report of productive cough howeve do not feel pressed to treat at this time as she is afeb. 
-- Cont to follow fever curve and WBC
-- F/up PA/Lat
-- Consider addition of abx for HAP if fever, PA/lat concerning
-- F/up Blood cultures and sputum cultures
-- F/up c diff


3. Hypertension: Home HTN regimen is Atenolol 50mg QD, HCTZ 25 qday, Lisinopril 40 qday, Losartan 50 BID
-- Start Captoril 50 mg Q8 and Lopressor 25 q8 and titrate up as needed fo tight BP control 
-- Cardiac monitor


4. DM type 2: Home regimen is Metformin/Glucotrol. 
-- D/c oral agents and start Insulin SS w BID BS


5. Hematuria/Proteinuria on U/A: Consisent with prior U/A


6. Breast CA: Cont Arimidex (hormone tx)


7. HL: Cont statin


8. Depression: Cont Prozac


9. Tobacco use: Cont Chantix 0.5 mg PO QDay


10. Anxiety: Ativan PRN at home. 
 
11. FEN:  Low chol, low sat fat, ADA diet with no added salt. Cont Vit D/ Calcium
 
12. PROPHYLAXIS:
GI:  Not indicated    DVT: Heparin 5000 Units SC BID    BOWEL:  Colace/Senna PRN


13. CODE STATUS:   Full Code       (Discussed with patient)

CC: 
Consult for radial artery harvest



HPI:  74 RHD M with coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Type II DM, peripheral arterial disease and prior cigarette abuse  admitted to the Vascular Surgery service on 3/8 with critical limb ischemia. On 03/09/2081, he underwent peroneal and popliteal angioplasty with thrombolysis of the femoral-popliteal bypass graft and stenting of the proximal anastomosis by Dr. Godfrey.  This was complicated by a postoperative MI. 03/15/2081, cardiac catheterization 
is significant for left main and multivessel coronary artery disease, and CABG was planned.  Of note, his cath was complicated by pseudoaneurysm of the right brachial artery at the point of access.   He was evaluated by SonoSite by the cardiac surgical PA, and was found to have no available venous conduit secondary to his multiple lower extremity procedures.  We are therefore consulted for radial artery harvest.

Patient Name: DO, TANYA V.;  MRN: 6051778
Dictated on: 09/08/2109 by TIBOR OQUINN, M.D. 

 
Ms. Tanya V. Do is an 81-year-old right-handed white woman with seropositive, nodular, erosive rheumatoid arthritis that was diagnosed in 2060, type II noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, vascular insufficiency in her legs, peripheral neuropathy, hearing loss in her left ear, right total hip arthroplasty surgery in 2070, right total knee arthroplasty surgery in 2081, left total knee arthroplasty surgery in 2082, a lumbar fusion performed in 2098 and again in 2099, a sigmoid colonic resection in 2103, cellulitis and osteomyelitis involving her right foot in October 2104, a cataract extracted from her right eye in 2102, a cataract extracted from her left eye in 2103, a transient ischemic attack in June 2106, and cellulitis involving her legs in 2107.  She returns to see me in rheumatologic follow-up at Rheumatology, this morning.  
 
Ms. Do has continued to take prednisone 5 mg by mouth twice daily, Celebrex 200 mg by mouth twice daily, and methotrexate 17.5 mg by mouth weekly, with good control of her joint pain, swelling, and stiffness.    
 
She continues to have difficulty grasping objects with her right hand, dropping objects that are held in that hand.  She also experiences numbness in her right ring and little fingers.  She wears a neutral resting splint on her right wrist for symptoms that she ascribes to right carpal tunnel syndrome.  She has opted not to undergo surgical treatment of her right ulnar neuropathy, after consultation with Dr. Kyron M. Castaneda of the hand surgery service at OGH.  
 
She has experienced inadequate treatment of her pain on Darvocet-N 100 two tablets taken by mouth once daily.   

She has continued to tolerate methotrexate therapy without symptoms of significant toxicity.  She has not experienced skin rashes, fevers, chills, sores in her nose or mouth, hair loss, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.   

She has continued to tolerate prednisone therapy without adverse symptoms other than for fragility of her skin and easy bruisability.  
 
She experienced improvement in her lower back discomfort following an epidural corticosteroid injection to her lower back on Jun 02, 2109.  She is scheduled to receive another epidural corticosteroid injection to her lower back on September 09, 2109.   

She has some difficulty dressing herself, getting in and out of bed, lifting a full cup or glass to her mouth, washing and drying her entire body, bending down to pick up clothing from the floor, and turning regular faucets on and off.  She has much difficulty walking outdoors on flat ground and getting in and out of an automobile.  She is unable to walk two miles or participate in sports or games to her liking. (MDHAQ = 1.8)  She has much difficulty getting a good night's sleep and she has some difficulty dealing with feelings of anxiety and depression.   

She is stiff throughout the day and experiences severe pain and severe fatigue.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital Signs  BP 148/60, P 64, RR 16, Temp 98.7 F, Wt 144 lb  Ms. Do was a very pleasant, cushingoid-appearing white woman in some distress due to pain.  Her skin was notable for ecchymoses on her extremities.  There was a healed skin graft on her left lower leg.  Well-healed scars were present over the lateral aspect of her right hip and over the anterior aspect of each knee.  There were no skin rashes.  Subcutaneous nodules, consistent with rheumatoid nodules, were present over the extensor surfaces of both elbows.  Her lungs were clear to auscultation.  Her cardiac examination revealed normal first and second heart sounds without murmurs or extra sounds.  Her musculoskeletal examination was notable for pain upon abduction and external rotation of her left shoulder.  There was ulnar deviation of the fingers of her right hand.  There was a boutonniere deformity of her left ring finger.  Bilateral hallux valgus deformities and cock-up toe deformities were present on both feet.  There was full painless motion of all small and large joints in both arms and legs without evidence of joint inflammation or of other significant joint deformity.  Her neurologic examination was notable for decreased sensation to light touch in the distribution of her right ulnar nerve, but was otherwise normal.  Her neurologic examination was normal with normal mental status, normal function of cranial nerves II through XII, normal muscle strength and tone in both arms and legs, intact sensation to light touch throughout, normal coordination, and symmetric deep tendon reflexes with downgoing plantar reflexes bilaterally. 
 
LABORATORY DATA:  I reviewed the laboratory data in the LMR with Ms. Do.  Studies performed at OGH on Jun 04, 2109, revealed ESR 19 mm/hr, CRP 10.6 mg/L, a benign urinalysis, ANA 1:80 with a speckled pattern of immunofluorescence, rheumatoid factor 165 IU/mL, and IgG anti-CCP antibodies 129 units.  

IMPRESSION:  
 
1.  Nodular, erosive rheumatoid arthritis since 2060, without evidence of synovitis on prednisone 5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Celebrex 200 mg p.o. b.i.d., and methotrexate 17.5 mg p.o. weekly.  She continues to be most limited by her right hand dysfunction and right ulnar neuropathy, but has opted to treat this conservatively.  
 
2.  Low back pain, treated with epidural corticosteroid injection on Jun 02, 2109.  
 
3.  Type II noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

4.  Vascular insufficiency in her legs.

5.  Peripheral neuropathy.

6.  Hearing loss in her left ear.

7.  Right total hip arthroplasty surgery in 2070.

8.  Right total knee arthroplasty surgery in 2081.

10. Left total knee arthroplasty surgery in 2082.

11. Lumbar fusion performed in 2098 and again in 2099.

12. Sigmoid colonic resection in 2103.

13. Cellulitis and osteomyelitis involving her right foot in October 2104.

14. Cataract extracted from her right eye in 2102.

15. Cataract extracted from her left eye in 2103.

16. Transient ischemic attack in June 2106.

17. Cellulitis involving her legs in 2107.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:  I discussed my impressions with Ms. Do.  I suggested that she increase her frequency of Darvocet-N 100 dosing to 2 tablets taken by mouth every 6 hours, as needed for pain control.  She will withhold a Tylenol dose, when she takes Darvocet N-100.  She will continue taking her other medications at their present doses.  
 
Laboratory studies will be performed today to assess her CBC, WBC differential count, plasma creatinine, ALT, AST, serum albumin, ESR, and CRP.  
 
Ms. Do will return to see me on December 11, 2109, at 9:40 a.m., so that I may assess her response to continued treatment and make any necessary changes in therapy.

Patient Name: LAGNSTON, SHERMAN I.;  MRN: 7223692
Dictated at: 12/09/67 by GARY J. HUGHES, MD 

 
FOLLOW UP NOTE 
 
DIAGNOSIS:  Renal cell carcinoma, presumably metastatic to T1.  Interval since conformal radiation therapy to vertebra T1 to a dose of 50.4 gray:  Three months.  
 
TUMOR STATUS:  Not available.  
 
NORMAL TISSUE STATUS:  No difficulty.  
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Mr. Lagnston is generally doing well with no deterioration and some improvement in his symptomatology.  He now has occasionally tingling in his feet and hands, which is possibly similar to before or less so.  He also has some posterior neck tingling, probably related to some position or activity and with lifting weight.  He has no weakness in any extremities.  His nocturia has decreased from three to one.  His hands feel a little ""fuzzy.""  The trembles, which he has had for some time are possibly better or the same, still a little worse on the left hand than the right.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination he looks well.  His weight is up to 230 pounds.  He has no percussible bony tenderness throughout.  His abdomen is entirely negative, so is his incision.  
 
IMPRESSION:  Clinically possibly slightly improved, certainly no evidence of progression.  
 
PLAN:  I will obtain a repeat chest and thoracic spine CT, as well as a bone scan.  Assuming that these are not indicative of further progression, I plan to see him in routine follow up in four to six months.  Dr. Levine would like some blood tests drawn on him, which I will happy to arrange when I hear exactly what they are.  Dr. Sweet is still seeing him frequently and giving him Norvasc and Atenolol for his blood pressure.

Dear Ken:

Mr. Ocampo returns to the office following his recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  As you know, Dr. Todd Banks took him to the operating room on August 17th, at which point, he underwent multivessel bypass surgery with placement of a left internal mammary artery to his LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to his PDA, first obtuse marginal, and second obtuse marginal.  He tolerated the procedure uneventfully.  His postoperative course was notable for intermittent atrial fibrillation for which he was eventually started on amiodarone therapy.  He also had some difficulty with urinary retention and had a Foley placed, which has stayed in since discharge.  He spent approximately 10 days in Gadsden Medical and has now been discharged to home.  Currently, he complains of a variety of musculoskeletal complaints involving his upper chest and left arm; however, he denies symptoms of active angina, congestive failure, or sensed arrhythmias.  He is slowly recovering his overall strength.

The last blood studies available to me indicate a random glucose of 118, creatinine of 1.1, normal liver function studies, cholesterol of 124, triglyceride of 124, HDL 39, LDL 60, hematocrit of 33.3.

On a regimen of amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Niferex 150 mg p.o. q.d., p.r.n. Tylenol No. 3, Hytrin 10 mg p.o. q.d., Proscar 5 mg p.o. q.d., Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. q.d., Pletal 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., possibly simvastatin at 20 mg p.o. q.d.

Physical exam today reveals a pleasant male in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/50, heart rate 65 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 183 pounds.  The neck is supple, JVP flat, carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities reveal markedly diminished peripheral pulses and 1+ pedal edema.

Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 60, PR interval 0.14, QRS 0.12, QT 0.38, axis -20 degrees.  There is evidence of left bundle-branch block with secondary ST and T-wave changes.  An echocardiogram performed prior to discharge revealed mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with a global ejection fraction of 40% at a time when he had a very rapid heart rate.  No subsequent echocardiogram has been performed when he is in sinus rhythm.

Impression and Plan:  Mr. Ocampo is making a slow but study recovery from his multivessel coronary bypass graft surgery.  I suggested he undergo repeat echocardiogram to document current left ventricular function now that he is back in sinus rhythm.  I told him he would stay on amiodarone for approximately 3-6 months, and assuming, he was in normal sinus rhythm throughout this time period, his amiodarone would then be discontinued.  At that time, I would also discontinue his Coumadin.  In addition, at the time of his diagnostic catheterization, he had evidence for severe peripheral vascular disease, and he understands that when he has completed his recovery from his recent surgery, I would strongly encourage further evaluation of his lower extremity arterial system with an eye toward potential percutaneous intervention.  In addition, I have asked him to obtain copies of his discharge summary from the Gadsden Medical Center.  I would like to resume ACE inhibitor therapy in light of his significant CAD and probable left ventricular dysfunction.  He will have routine blood studies obtained today.  I would target his LDL cholesterol to the 70 range.  Beyond this, I have not altered his current regimen.

Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in his care.

Sincerely yours,

RE:                   Walter Uribe
HBH: 
            406-70-33
DOB:               3/22/68



Dear Dr. Joshua Morgan:



I am seeing this 55-year-old gentleman in the office today for evaluation of lymphedema and chronic venous stasis in both lower extremities.  The patient has had innumerable episodes of ulceration, which heal with TubiGrip and Profore dressings ultimately to break down again.  The patient has been discharged from the TNA and as I understand it the question is put to me today is whether the patient is a candidate for a Lymphapress.  The patient has had chronic bilateral lower extremity discoloration and swelling for over ten years.  He has never worn compression stockings.  He has had multiple episodes of recurrent ulcers.  To the best of his knowledge he has never had phlebitis but has had Unna boots in the past.  The patient denies any prolonged hospitalization, long bone fractures or prior history of DVT. 
There is no family history of varicose veins or DVT.  He has no personal history of cancer or trauma.  He has not been involved in any prolonged travel, does not take any hormone medication and is unemployed.  



The patient's past medical history is notable for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, peripheral neuropathy, morbid obesity, hypertension and pulmonary hypertension. 



His current medications include lisinopril, verapamil, metformin, furosemide, aspirin, vitamin C, Spiriva and Advair.  



The patient denies any family history of cancer, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia or bleeding.  



The patient was raised in Dothan and lives in Galion.  He does not work, denies alcohol abuse and quit tobacco eight years ago.



His review of systems is notable for right upper quadrant pain, dyspnea, glasses, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.



On physical exam he is a morbidly obese gentleman with intertriginous rashes question fungal origin in the axilla on the right.  He has distant breath sounds with fine expiratory wheezes.  He has some tenderness in the right upper quadrant to palpation.  He has a huge protuberant abdomen.  There is no tenderness in the right upper quadrant.  He has bounding carotid, brachial and radial pulses.  His femoral pulses are not palpable likely due to his body habitus.  On the left his dorsalis pedis is 1+ and on the right his posterior tibial was 2+.  He has huge legs with evidence of stasis dermatitis and lipodermatosclerosis, which is greater on the left than the right.  He has prominent varices on his right thigh near the takeoff of what appears to be an anterolateral accessory branch.  He has severe brawny induration, discoloration and superficial ulcers on the right with none on the left.  The patient seems somewhat reserved but is quite communicative when prompted.



The results of his noninvasive vascular lab studies showed bilateral greater saphenous vein reflux.  The reflux is confined to the first accessory saphenous vein in the right leg and the saphenopopliteal junction in the proximal thigh.  It should be noted that the reflux in the saphenopopliteal junction on the right is 0, in the anterolateral saphenous vein on the right it is 3 seconds and in the small saphenous vein on the right the reflux is 3 seconds.  In the deep femoral vein, common femoral and superficial femoral vein there is no reflux.  In contrast on the left there is reflux at the saphenopopliteal junction of a mere 3 seconds, in the proximal greater saphenous vein 3 seconds, midthigh 3 seconds and distal thigh 3 seconds.  In the popliteal vein there is no reflux and the small saphenous vein there is 3 seconds.  Due to the patient's size it was difficult to identify perforators.  



In summary, we have a morbidly obese gentleman with mild to moderate reflux on examination and severe stasis dermatitis and discoloration.  Thus there is a mismatch between the degree of physical findings and objective laboratory data.  I believe that this is the case primarily because the patient cannot lie flat and often sleeps with his legs in a dependent position.  Thus he has an ongoing stasis in his legs due to inactivity and dependency.  This in addition to his morbid obesity, that is a girth of 385 pounds that presses on his abdomen 24 hours a day, seven days a week and compresses the vena cava as well as the lymphatic drainage of his legs.  All of these factors taken into account contribute to his discoloration, ulceration and lower extremity swelling.



The solution to this problem is not an easy one.  With his obstructive sleep apnea and abdominal girth the chances of him objectively putting his legs up so they are higher than his belly or heart are nonexistent.  Certainly it is not unreasonable to use a Lymphapress machine to help remove some of the swelling and edema that this patient experiences in his legs, however a Lymphapress is not a maintenance device but is an interventional device.  If we do not have a plan as to what to put on his legs after the Lymphapress is removed in between treatments it will be of no long-term benefit.  I would recommend that he use a Lymphapress machine and intermittent wraps with 6 to 8 inch ACE wraps.  I would always make the tension in the ACE wraps at the level of the ankle and heel greater than the midcalf.  I have given him a prescription for a Lymphapress machine as well as ACE wraps and discussed the relevant components of his care, which are important.  I hope that these interventions will help him with his lower extremity edema and swelling.  It is unlikely that any intervention at the level of his veins will overcome the terrible hydrostatic pressure of his abdomen and total body girth.  If I can provide any additional information regarding Mr. Uribe, please let me know.



Sincerely,






Michael D. Roe, M.D.

Dear Dr. Overman: 
I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Wendell Urquhart, in consultation today. The patient presents complaining of lower back pain with right lower extremity radiation. He develop symptoms gradually three months ago with no history of preceding trauma. The symptoms became progressively worse. The patient has a history of lower back injury 30 years ago in a motor vehicle accident - at that time he was diagnosed with disc rupture. Currently the pain is intermittent and occurs daily. He grades the intensity of the pain as up to 7 to 8 out of 10 on the numerical pain scale. He describes it as sharp shooting sensation in the lower back with radiation all the way down right lower extremity to the foot. The symptoms are worse with standing; better with sitting and lying down. There is no change in the intensity of symptoms with coughing or sneezing. The patient any recent fever or chills, no loss of bowel or bladder control. He describes occasional intermittent numbness in the right leg and foot. He denies any weakness. He lost 30 pounds through dieting over the past two months. The pain does not wake the patient up at night. 
Diagnostically, the patient denies any recent imaging studies of the lumbar spine. 


Therapeutically, the patient denies any recent physical therapy; no previous injections or surgical procedures of the lumbar spine. Currently he takes nabumetone 750 mg once in the morning with moderate relief of his symptoms. He also occasionally takes Naproxen at night with moderate relief. 
MEDICATIONS: 
1. Aspirin. 
2. Hydrochlorothiazide. 
3. Toprol. 
4. Caduet. 
5. Nabumetone as needed.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient works as a programmer for Dish Network. He is married with no children. He does not smoke, drinks alcohol socially, and denies illicit drug use. 
FAMILY HISTORY: There is no history of medical problems that run in the family. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The complete review of systems was performed including constitutional, eyes, ENT, cardiovascular, respiratory, GI, GU, musculoskeletal, integument, neurological, psychiatric, endocrine, lymphatic, and immunologic. It is positive for musculoskeletal complains and medical problems as above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is well-developed, moderately overweight man in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented to time, person and place. His mood and affect are stable. He demonstrates good attention and concentration. The patient ambulates without an assistive device with normal heel strike and toe off.  He is able to stand on his heels and toes. He is able to walk heel to toe in a straight line with intact balance. Vital signs are stable. Sclera is anicteric, no ptosis noted, no lymphadenopathy, unlabored respiration, abdomen is soft and non-tender, no skin rash.  


There is limited range of motion in the lumbar spine with flexion limited to 60 degrees, extension limited to 10 degrees. There is no tenderness to palpation over the spinous processes, paraspinal muscles, SI joints or greater trochanteric bursae bilaterally. There is full 5/5 strength in the lower extremities with intact sensation bilaterally.  1+ reflexes in the knees, absent reflexes in the ankles bilaterally. There is downgoing Babinski, no clonus, normal tone in the lower extremities. Straight leg raise test is negative bilaterally. There is no pain with hip internal and external rotation. 



Cervical range of motion is within normal limit. There is no tenderness to palpation over cervical spinous processes and paraspinal muscles. There is full 5/5 strength in the upper extremities with intact sensation bilaterally. Symmetrical reflexes in the biceps, brachioradialis and triceps bilaterally. Negative Hoffmans sign and Spurlings maneuver.  The range of motion in bilateral upper extremities is normal. 
IMAGING: During today's visit I reviewed x-ray study of the pelvis dated September 24 2132. it demonstrates lumbosacral spondylosis in the visualized lumbosacral spine. 
For complete description of the study, please see formal radiology report. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Sub-acute lower back pain with right lower extremity radiation, non-focal neurological examination. 
2. Lumbar radiculitis. 
3. Degenerative disc disease. 
4. Lumbar spondylosis. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. MRI study of the lumbar spine will be obtained to further evaluate etiology of ongoing symptoms. The patient will discuss with radiologist if MRI study can not be performed due to cardiac stents. 
2. Upon review of the imaging studies, a lumbar epidural steroid injection would be considered to decrease the inflammatory component of his symptoms and to inhibit peripheral nociceptive transmission. 
3. The patient was encouraged to remain active and to participate in low-impact aerobic exercises to prevent deconditioning. He was encouraged to continue with weight loss program. 
4. The therapeutic plan was discussed with the patient. All of his questions were answered. He will be seen in follow-up after imaging study is completed in 1-2 weeks. 



Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient. Please do not hesitate to call my office for any further questions. 


Sincerely,

Mr. Sparks is a 74 yr. M who was seen by me as a new patient in Nov. 10 and again in Dec. 10. He RTC.



HPI: This visit was supposed to be a preoperative visit prior to his scheduled Feb. 02 right inguinal hernia repair with Dr. Yamaguchi. However, when I saw him in Dec he had inadequate BP control despite Dr. Arias doubling his Lisinopril. I DCed Atenolol and switched him to Labetalol 100 mg BID. Despite some confusion I believe he has done this. He had also been switched from Crestor to Lipitor due to safety concerns. Labs done pre-operatively are notable for:

Creatinine     3.4

LDL          184

nct.           35%



Problems

Adenomatous polyp : May 2078

Gastritis : H. pylori positive

Chronic renal dysfunction 

Diabetes mellitus type 2 

Hypertension 

Hyperlipidemia 

Anemia 

hyperparathyroidism 

Transient ischemic attack 



Medications

Amlodipine 10 MG (10MG TABLET take 1) PO QD 

Glipizide 10 MG (10MG TABLET take 1) PO BID 

Pioglitazone 15 MG (15MG TABLET take 1) PO QD 

Clopidogrel 75 MG (75MG TABLET take 1) PO QD 

Furosemide 20 MG (20MG TABLET take 1) PO BID 

Ferrous GLUCONATE 300 MG PO BID 

Lisinopril 80 MG (40MG TABLET ) PO QD , by Dr. Arias.

Atorvastatin 40 MG (40MG TABLET take 1) PO QD 

Labetalol HCL 100 MG (100MG TABLET take 1) PO BID 



Allergies

Aspirin - ulcer, : Allergy entered as ASA 

Habits: no cigarettes, drugs or alcohol;



ROS: denies weight change, fever, chills, fatigue, blurry vision, chest pains, palpitations, dyspnea, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, change in bowel/bladder habits, joint pain, dizziness, exanthem, edema. 



PE notable for:

Well nourished well appearing M;

Vital Signs

BP 184/90, P 72, Wt 236 lb

O2 SAT 99 %

HEENT: sclera clear white OU, EOMI, ear canals and TMs wnl AU; oropharynx without lesions.

LN: No palpable neck or SC LN;

Cardiac: RRR, rate 72, no extra sounds

Resp.: good air movement, no accessory muscle use, no adventitious sounds



Plan:

1. Hypertension: continues to be inadequate in a diabetic.We have limited options; increasing Lisinopril did not add much. Switch to Labetalol did not help, but he is also not beta-blocked (HR 72) so I am increasing Labetalol to 200 mg BID.

2. Diabetes: control has been good.

3. Renal insufficiency

4. Hyperlipidemia: we may need to increase Lipitor and/or add Zetia.

5. Right inguinal hernia: RTC one week for hopefully better pre-op. BP

Assessment/Plan:



45 yo F with multiple medical problems, particularly obesity, tobacco history, DM presenting with significant EKG changes in inferior distribution. Because the cath lab was occupied, ward cardiology opted to forego delay and treated her with Reteplase x 2 with excellent results, including resolution of symptoms and resolution of EKG changes.



1.	Ischemia.

Now on plavix, statin. 

Has received ASA several times during this evaluation. Allergy is GI upset. Clarify with aim of continuing daily ASA for vascular prophylaxis.

Continue heparin peri-event period.

Needs ACE I for remodeling as well as risk reduction as pt has DM.

She merits further definition of her coronary anatomy by catheterization in 1-2 days. Lysis has risk of restenosis, plus may have additional lesion of borderline significance.

High risk for post-lytic restenosis; follow daily EKG, symptoms, markers.

If pt unwilling to undergo cath, then echo plus stress test for characterization of risk stratification.



2.	Pump.

Slightly volume overloaded, can administer lasix 20 IV now.

Echo to evaluate post-event remodeling, define anatomy and physiology.

Advance lopressor as tolerated.



3.	DM.

Checking sugars QID. Holding hypoglycemics.

She will require tight control peri-infarct.

	Cont medications for glaucoma.



4.	Psychiatric.

Pt's out-pt regimen will be maintained during this hospitalization. No indication for psychiatric consult.



5.	Hypothyroidism.

Maintain on current dosage of levoxyl w/out checking TFTs during hospitalization.



6.	Chronic pain.

Cont neurontin.

Provide low-dose narcotic as previously scheduled on out-pt med list.

7.	Prophylaxes.

Nexium; on heparin post-event.

INPATIENT CONSULTATION

PATIENT: Ulysses Quin
LMH NUMBER: 9523697
REFERRING PHYSICIAN: Dr. Ziemba 
DATE OF Consultation: 3/08/76

PATIENT ID: Mr. Quin is a 74 y/o gentleman with metastatic prostate cancer, new L4 met with pain who is seen for consideration of radiation therapy.
 
HPI:  
Mr. Quin's oncological history begain in 2061 when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer (unknown gleason, PSA).  He underwent radical prostatectomy in 2061 and salvage XRT in 2062.  His care was at BNH and we don't have his XRT records.  The patient recalls 37 treatments.   The patient was well until he had an elevated PSA of 3.52 in 10/75.  He underwent a bone scan in 11/75 showing worrisome uptake at L5. In 1/76 he had a PSA of 17.46.  He has also developed lower back pain requiring MS Contin for pain control.  His course was complicated by a possible bladder/urethral infection.  He is incontinent from his surgery.  In 2/76 he had a cystoscopy which revealed nodules in the bladder (TCC vs. prostatic scar/inflammation).  
The patient's LLP worsened.   He reports occasional severe shooting pain that lead to gait imbalance.  On the day of presentation, he experienced severe acute back pain while getting out of bed.  The pain was so intolerable that he asked his daughter to bring him to the emergency room. Just before arrival to the ED he developed stridor, in his words he was    sucking air in and out.     ENT was consulted in the ED and determined that he had a limited glottic gap, and that the acute stridor was most likely secondary to anxiety and increased air flow through a restricted glottic opening, recommending humidified air by shovel air mask, steroids, and outpatient followup.  MRI of the lumbar spine showed metastatic disease involving of the L4 vertebral body, extending into the pedicles, both L4-5 neural foramina, and the prevertebral soft tissues.  No compression of the thecal sac.

Mr. Quin reports improved pain since admission.  He still has some pain when moving from one position to anther.  he denies fecal incontinence, saddle anesthesia, LE weakness or paresthesia.  He would like to be cared at the LMH from now on.  The patient had an oncologist from BNH but does not remember his name.

IMPRESSION and PLAN:   
74 y/o gentleman with metastatic prostate cancer, new L4 metastasis and pain.  The patient's LBP is likely due to his spine met.  Based on the MRI results, his symptoms and his exam we believe he is an appropriate candidate for palliative radiotherapy to his L-spine.  I discussed with Mr. Quin the likely cause of his pain.  We then discussed the treatment options.  Mr. Quin would like to undergo a course of palliative radiotherapy to relieve his pain.  We will simulate (plan) the patient's XRT tomorrow am, with a treatment to follow on the same day.  All of the patient's questions were answered to his satisfaction.  We would also recommend an GU oncology consultation regarding the patient's ADT and other possible systemic therapies.  The patient only had L-spine MRI, a bone scan may be of benefit to establish the extent of metastatic disease.

	OCHILTREE GENERAL HOSPITAL
	


	Reason for visit:
   The patient is a 61 yo Equadorian male admitted for cardiac cath after an episode of chest pain with? positive markers.


	Interval History:
   The  patient was  transferred to OGH in 3/2067 because of chest pain with positive markers and aaaanterolateral T wave changes.At which time he was diagnosed with possible ETOH myocarditis. His EF was 34%. He underwent cardiac cath which showed that the Left Main and LAD were patent, , a very distal LCX lesion. RCA was dominant and patent. The patient was discharged to home on a program of ace, BB, ASA and instructed to curtail his ETOH use. His EF improved to 66 %. He had repeat nuclear stress testing which showed small anterior infarct/small prior inferior infarct and was negative for ischemia in July 2068..
   Since then he has had a stable angina pattern with chest pain brought on when he has to move very heavy objects in his work as a packager . This is usually relieved with one TNG. Most recently, he was seen by his PC Dr. Thomson and treated with Augmentin/Robitussin AC for a URI. He had a productive cough  and some chest discomfort related to coughing. 
   Most recently, he was brought into police custody for public intoxication. While in his jail cell,""resting"" he developed the sudden onset on midsternal sharp chest pain accompanied by heavy breathing. There was no radiation to the arms, but he noted bilateral hand numbness. He also had palpitations and sweating and felt nauseated. He received one sl TNG. An ambulance was called and he received 2 TNG sprays. His pain diminished. His BP was 176/100 at the time. He was brought to the Evanston Hospital ER and found to have ""high lateral changes"" on his EKG's. Troponins were slightly elevated at .13- considered a ""gray zone"" for the hospitals range  for MI. The patient was pain free after a dose of Morphine. While in the hospital, he was placed on suicide watch. He has a history of a suicide attempt 3 years ago and has previously had counseling and been on antidepressants. He has a son who is in a vegetative state after an MVA whom he helps care for and this is very stressful. His recent arrest made hiite despondent. At Evanston Hospital, he was started on a beta blocker and Lovenox. He had a suboptimal stress test which was stopped because of SSCP and nausea. He is now transferred to OGH for further evaluation.

	Assessment and plan:
   The patient is a 47 yo diabetic, with known CAD, improved EF after d/c of ETOH now admitted after episode of chest pain with ? EKG changes and  ""intermediate""Troponins per local hospital assay.Case reviewed with Dr. Levine. Would continue ASA, beta Blocker and Lisinopril in addition to usual meds. He has previous CAD and is diabetic. Even though stess test was suboptimal, he has risk factors of diabetes, obesity and hypertension, and 50 % LCX lesion , so would proceed with cath tomorrow. NPO after midnight for cath lab. He is currently pain free so no heparin for now. Would check serial EKG;s, and troponins in addition to usual labs. Please obtain fasting cholesterol panel.

Will need psychiatric consult to aseess suicidality though he currently denies this.

Agree hold NSAIDs/Voltaren intil after cath.

DIAGNOSTIC TESTS / CARDIOLOGY DATA:

No acute ischemic changes, no signif change from previous.  Pos. PVC.  Pos. PVC and bigeminy on telemetry.



RADIOLOGY:

Lower extremity dopplers neg. for DVT.

Plain films of lower extremities neg. for gas or osteal elevation.





IMPRESSION: 50 yo man with chronic venous stasis and exacerbation of RLE skin breakdown, left shift in WBCs, and chest pain with dysrhythmia.



PLAN:

1.	Cellulitis:  Despite DM and venous stasis, lesion that the patient has is very superficial, and therefore need not be treated as a diabetic ulcer, requiring coverage for pseudomonas and anaerobes.  This is rather a simple cellulitis, and may be treated with Ancef.  Consult wound care nurse to recommend appropriate dressings and care of wound.  Consider c/s surgery for unaboots.  No debridement necessary.  Send blood cx - monitor for bloodstream seeding.  Consider MRI of LE to r/o osteomyelitis, however, doubt such a shallow ulceration could cause it.

2.	Chest pain with bigeminy and PVCs:  Rule out for MI by enzymes x3, as ?new dysrhythmia may signify ?myocardial irritation/damage.  Monitor EKG and telemetry.  If ruled out, consider inpt vs. outpt adenoside mibi.  Check lipid panel to further elucidate CAD risk, possibly start a statin.

3.	Deconditioning/SOB:  Consult PT/OT to assist with mobility and exercise tolerance.  

4.	Prophylaxis:  Fragmin.  Counsel re: weight loss.

Patient: Langston, Sherman

Unit #: 7223692

Location: Ol 11

Referring Attending: Null



Reason for consult:  BRBPR



HPI: The patient is a 62 year old male with history of CAD s/p stents of LAD lesion in February 2070 readmit with chest pain.  At the time of this stenting, he had total occlusion of his midRCA and mid circumflex with collaterals.  He presented with recurrent CP in May, and he underwent a second cath that revealed patent LAD with stent.  This admission he had a 10-15 minute episode of chest and jaw pain with tachycardia and hypertension by home monitoring.  The pain resolved with two sublingual nitroglycerins.  He went to Butte Ridge Associates where he was placed on heparin.  In the setting of heparin bolus with PPT >150, he had one episode, moderate volume of painless rectal bleeding.  Since transfer, still on heparin, he had no further bleeding, nor guiac positive stool until today.   This morning he passed a large brown bowel movement which was guiac negative.  Following this, after returning to bed, he had a small amount of oozing of blood from his rectum.  He had no abdominal pain.  No further bleeding since this morning.  He has never had rectal bleeding previously on aspirin and plavix.  His colonoscopy in 2066 revealed diverticulosis.  He is currently on aspirin, plavix, heparin with therapeutic PTT.

62 year old male with CAD with chest pain to be evaluated by cardiac cath with painless BRBPR following a large bowel movement today in the setting of heparin, aspirin and plavix.  This bleeding was minimal and self-limited, most likely of hemorrhoidal origin, rather than diverticular.  He does have some risk of recurrent rectal bleeding on these blood thinners, but the bleeding is likely to continue to be limited.  There is no contraindication to cardiac catherization or continuing these important medications.  There is also no intervention we could do now to adjust the risk.  Would recommend proceeding to cardiac catherization.  No alteration in medications required.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Ogrady is a 66-year-old gentleman who is coming in to Grafton Clinic to establish care and to discuss several medical issues.

1.  Pain.  He has whole body pain, mostly in his abdomen and his leg, and this has been longstanding for 2 years' time.  Has been treating with Percocet initially at about 3-4 per day but most recently, as high as 6 per day and in fact, 6 per day is the average.  He was seen in the pain clinic and was started on Neurontin.  It is unclear how compliant he has been with that regimen.  Dr. Hoover has been renewing his Percocet prescriptions.  He has had a CAT scan done in the past because of a history of esophageal cancer, which showed no evidence of cancer or no other etiology for his pain.

2.  Esophageal cancer status post resection by Dr. Patton.  He has been doing okay from that standpoint, is followed up with Dr. Yan.  The last CT scan was in June 2095 that showed some pulmonary nodules and a renal cyst that needed followup.  He has not yet had a repeat CT scan that was scheduled for yesterday, and he did not go to the appointment because he wants to do it at the Cancer Center where he feels more relaxed.

3.  Coronary artery disease.  He is status post an MI in 2084.  He has had several angiograms but no angioplasties by his report.  He is followed by Dr. Mckee at the Trimont Health Care Center.

4.  Status post fem-pop bypass of the left side.  He says he has been having increasing pain over the last several years on that side, which is why he takes the Percocet.  



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus with unclear control.  His last hemoglobin A1c was 6.5 and that was in 10/94.  Status post cholecystectomy, status post appendectomy, esophageal cancer status post resection, and history of idiopathic thrombocytopenia.



MEDICATIONS:  Diovan 80 mg p.o. b.i.d., metformin 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d., Prilosec 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.  Percocet 5/325 six times per day, Dyazide 37.5/25 one time p.o. q.d., isosorbide 60 mg p.o. q.d., and Lopressor 125 mg  p.o. q.d.  



SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with his wife.  He is retired.  He used to smoke, quit in 2084.  Smoked for 20 years 2 packs per day.  No alcohol, no drugs.  



FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died of cancer, unclear what type.  Father died of an MI and had diabetes mellitus.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Comprehensive review of systems was done and reveals that that he has chronic abdominal pain that is unchanged, occasional chest pain, and chest palpitations that has been evaluated by his cardiologist.  No fevers or chills.  No burning or pain with urination.  The rest of the review of systems was negative.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, his blood pressure is 122/80 and his pulse is 80.  His height is 6 feet and his weight is 230 pounds.  In general, he is in no acute distress.  He is well appearing.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Conjunctivae noninjected.  Pupils equal, round, and react to light.  His extraocular are movements intact.  Oropharynx is without erythema or exudate.  Oral mucosa is moist.  Neck has no significant lymphadenopathy.  JVP is flat.  His thyroid is within normal bilaterally.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Good aeration, good air movement, no accessory muscle use.  Cardiac exam is regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2.  He has a systolic murmur, which has been reported previously.  His abdominal exam is soft, nontender, nondistended.  He has a large central hernia.  He has several surgical scars.  His extremities, he has no edema, his DP pulses are 1+ bilaterally.  His reflexes are trace in the knees, toes are downgoing.  His skin exam, he has multiple nevi, some that are rather dark.  No specifically suspicious lesion.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  A 66-year-old gentleman with multiple medical issues.

1.  Diabetes, recheck hemoglobin A1c today.  He is going to find out when the last time it was he had an eye exam.

2.  Pain.  He has had this pain syndrome for quite some time.  He is on short-acting narcotic and I think this is appropriate.  I am going to start him on a fentanyl patch 25 mcg p.o. q.d. and decrease his Percocet to 4 per day.  Hopefully, we will be able to wean him off his Percocet altogether.

3.  Esophageal cancer.  Follow up with Dr. Yan and Dr. Patton.

4.  Pulmonary nodule.  I emphasized the need for him to repeat his CT scan.  I sent an email to Dr. Yan.  He wants to only do them at the Cancer Center and that is where last films were done.  I explained how important it was.

4.  Idiopathic thrombocytopenia.  We are going to watch this.  He had a workup by Dr. Sawyer in the past.  He reports no bleeding.

5.  Coronary artery disease.  I asked him to get Dr. Landers's records for me, especially his last angiogram.  We are going to check his cholesterol today.  He will follow up with me in approximately 1 month's time to reevaluate his pain.

6.  His EKG today shows a sinus rhythm at the rate of 60, normal intervals, normal axis, and poor R-wave progression in the precordial leads and as indicated above, possible septal infarct and possible inferior infarct.  I do not have a baseline for comparison.4. 5.

NAME:    Wilson, Gabriel

MRN:     8514931



The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension,

hyperlipidemia and multiple other medical problems. She has a history of TIAs and

was seeing the neurologist today for follow up. She has not had recent TIA symptoms

but related a history of exertional chest pain and was sent up here for evaluation.

Griggs was translating and the patient reports that over the past two months she

has been getting chest pain and pressure with some shortness of breath after she

walks about one block. The symptom is a pressure symptom which radiates to both

sides of her chest. It is not severe, sharp chest pain. It does not radiate to her back.

There is no associated rest pain or nocturnal pain. No PND, orthopnea or edema.

The last time she had the pain was two weeks ago. She has a history of TIAs and our

goal was to keep her blood pressure in the 140-160 range since they may be due to a

low flow state due to her vertebrobasilar disease.



She is on aspirin and Plavix.



She had a negative sestamibi ETT in 2087 except she had a very low work capacity.

She has not had a recent stress test.  



PHYSICAL EXAM: She is a very pleasant woman in no acute distress. Her blood

pressure is 160/70. Neck supple without JVD or bruits. Lungs clear without wheezes,

rales or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1, S2, no diastolic murmur

or gallop. Abdomen soft, nontender without hepatosplenomegaly. No edema.  



Her EKG shows normal sinus rhythm. 



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient with multiple cardiac risk factors and a story

which sounds convincing for exertional angina. She has not had any symptoms in over

two weeks. Will add low-dose Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. She should stop it if she

feels lightheaded on the medication. She should increase the aspirin to 325 q.d. We

will schedule her for a sestamibi ETT. She will follow-up in one week.

Date of Admission: 12/08/96

Cardiologist: Dr Dailey 



ID/CC:75 YO M with chest pain 	







HPI: 

This pleasant 75 YO M presents today after multiple episodes of sharp L anterior chest pain. The first episode started this AM (10AM). It was left sided with out radiation non positional or pleuritic. Denies any associated sx such as palpitations, SOB, n,v. Although he has had a mild cough with throat irratation over the past few days.  He was attributing this pain to gas but he took an aspirin and (expired) nitroglycerine SL just in case. He had an anteroseptal MI in 2092 and when questioned he does not feel this pain is similar to his prior attack.  Later that day he had another episode of pain for which he felt more worried about, called the EMS for evaluation of a cardiac cause of his pain. On route to the Hospital the EMS gave SL nitro which relieved the pain. He was evaluated in the ED where he had EKG, cardiac enzymes and was given his normal dose of beta blocker. His EKG when compared showed evidence of his old anterior septal MI, possibly slightly inverted T waves in I,AVL and deeper T wave  inversions in V1-3. 

First 2 sets of cardiac enzymes have been normal and he has remained CP free since the last nitro. 



ROS:   No F/C/NS.  No change in weight/appetite. No Palpitations/Orthopnea/PND/LE edema/Claudication. No SOB/cough/hemoptysis/wheezing/sore throat/rash.  No N/V/D/hematochezia/melena.

EDVISIT^32707420^GIPSON, ALEC^07/25/60^YERGER, DESEAN

The patient was seen with Dr. Godfrey.  I confirmed her history

and physical.  I also interviewed and examined the patient. 

Please see the note for more details.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old gentleman with

a history of hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and 2

weeks of intermittent chest pain for which he was evaluated with

stress test a week prior to ED visit, which was abnormal.  The

patient had a plan for cardiac catheterization the day after this

ED visit but presented on this day for an episode of chest

discomfort which occurred at rest, which was unlike his previous

episodes of chest discomfort which usually occurred with

activity.  He took nitroglycerin with relief and then presented

for further evaluation and treatment.

MEDICATIONS:  Metformin, Toprol, Cozaar, nitro, aspirin, and

Altace.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake and alert, in no distress,

chest pain free.  Afebrile with pulse 72, blood pressure 129/69,

and O2 saturation 98% on room air.  His lungs are clear to

auscultation.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft

and nontender.  Extremities are warm and well perfused.  No

elevated JVP.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  An EKG was done revealing right

bundle-branch block, but sinus rhythm at 67 with no ischemic

changes.  IV access was established.  Labs were sent revealing

essentially normal CBC and electrolytes.  Initial troponin was

less than assay with an INR of 1.1 and chest x-ray, which was

normal.  The patient has been taking aspirin prior to arrival. 

Heart rate was in the 60s in the emergency room and no additional

beta-blockade was given to the patient.  However, based on his

story, which was suggestive for unstable angina, he was given

Lovenox in the emergency room.  I spoke to the Cardiology B

attending on call who agreed to take the patient on to his

service for probable cardiac catheterization in the near future. 

With this plan, he was admitted in stable condition with a

diagnosis of unstable angina.

CRITICAL CARE TIME:  50 minutes.

(660) 857-3335                     04/19/2088


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Neil comes in today to follow up on multiple medical issues, the first of which is his benign prostatic hypertrophy.  He states that since beginning the Flomax that we started him on in January, his symptoms are at least 50% better.  He is only getting up once per night to go to the bathroom and is not having any hesitancy or difficulty passing his urine.  He is also following up on his elevated cholesterol, his hypertension.  He states that he has been trying to follow a better diet, but does state that he has not been particularly good about getting regular exercise.  He is also following up on his diabetes.  He is not having any difficulty with his medications.  He did not schedule his colonoscopy that I had referred him for in January but states that he would be willing to do so after the spring.  He is also following up on his COPD.  He states that he has been using the Pulmicort and the Spiriva as well as the Serevent Diskus on a daily basis.  He states that his breathing has been good.  He is hardly wheezing at all and he has better exercise tolerance than before.  He is also noted to have hepatitis C as well as fatty liver.  A recent ultrasound also demonstrated gallstones.  He does not have any postprandial symptoms of right upper quadrant pain, nausea or vomiting.  He does question whether or not he is a candidate for treatment of hepatitis C.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for B-cell lymphoma, pontine stroke, basilar artery stent, herpes zoster, graft versus host disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, Pseudomonas pneumonia, COPD, diabetes, heart murmur, BPH and hepatitis C as well as gallstones and fatty liver.

MEDICATIONS:  Serevent Diskus, metformin, folate, Flomax, Spiriva, albuterol, Lopressor, Combivent, Pulmicort, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, magnesium and aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  He has an allergy to ACE inhibitors, dapsone, ganciclovir, sulfa, and Bactrim.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 140/90, on repeat 148/90, pulse is 64, temperature 97.1 and weight is 259 pounds.  In general, he is in no acute distress.  The HEENT exam demonstrates no icterus and no injection.  The oropharynx is clear.  Neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes and no rales.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The abdomen is soft, nondistended, and nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  The extremities show no edema.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Diabetes, his most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.5 and this does not need to be done again until July.  He was advised again to continue to follow a healthy diet and offered again referral to a nutritionist, currently declines at this time.  He is up-to-date with his Ophthalmology exam.
2.  BPH.  We will increase his Flomax to 0.8 mg to see if we can further improve his symptoms.  Fortunately they are responding quite well to this.
3.  Hypertension.  This is not adequate control with his current regimen, however, we are increasing his Flomax today so I would like to see how he does in terms of his blood pressure when I see him back in a month.  If his blood pressure is still elevated, we will then modify his antihypertensive regimen to improve this.
4.  COPD.  Currently, he is doing well with his current regimen.  He has no evidence of a flare at this time and he is advised to continue getting as much exercise as possible.
5.  Elevated cholesterol.  His LDL goal should be less than 100 if not less than 70 given his multiple medical issues.  If his LDL is greater than 70 on this most recent check we may try him on a small dose of simvastatin to see if we can get him under goal without an elevation in his liver function tests.
6.  Abnormal liver function tests.  These are a combination of his hepatitis C and the fatty liver.  It is reasonable to have him seen in Hepatology to see if he would be a candidate for treatment of the hepatitis C.  For now, we will work on his diabetes, weight loss and management of his cholesterol and we will refer him to Hepatology.  Follow up with me is in one month.

Re:  	Quijano, Donny 

	SMC Unit # 544-84-52



Dear Dr. Galvan:



I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Quijano, in followup for episodes of dyspnea, in the setting of asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, myasthenia gravis and distant coronary disease.



He reports that his    spasms    of unpredictable exertional breathlessness have continued to be substantially in remission, occurring less than once a week and sometimes only every two weeks.  Swallowing is fine with fewer choking episodes when he drinks water, but no problem with the ingestion of other substances.  



No cough, phlegm, lower extremity edema, chest pain or chest infections.



No reflux symptoms.



Sneezing spells and coryza, especially in the morning, have been most noticeable in the past several months.



He enjoyed his trip to Romania, and had only two days when he had a couple of minor spells.



Medications:  Advair, 100/50, one puff b.i.d. (continues the 10 second breath hold); lisinopril; atenolol; Mestinon; Metformin; no proton pump inhibitor.



On examination, he is his usual fit-appearing self.  Blood pressure is 130/70, respiratory rate 18 and unlabored, heart rate 55 and regular.  Conjunctivae are clear.  Sinuses nontender.  Nasal passages are narrowed but without inflammation.  Oropharynx:  Mild crowding in the posterior pharynx, but there were no definite exudates.  No goiter or adenopathy.  Back:  Normal configuration.  Chest:  Normal percussion note, faint prolongation of the expiratory phase without definite wheezes.  Cardiac:  Vague cardiac impulse, 1/6 systolic mid to late systolic murmur at the apex, JVP 8 cm with borderline HJR, no S3.  Abdomen:  Soft, scaphoid, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Skin:  Well tanned.



Pulmonary function tests today show regression of the FEV1 from 2.09 liters on 6/27 to 1.72 liters, similar to the 1.62 liter value of 6/13, with an FVC that has decreased from 3.47 on 6/27 to 2.8 liters now, although with an FET of only 8.5 versus 14.3.



CT scan today, by my review - A tiny nodule in the extreme right apex, mildly thickened bronchi in the extreme left lower lobe, status post mediasternotomy with diffuse calcification of the coronary arteries.



Impression:



Episodic dyspnea due to asthma, with underlying excellent functional status and because of his stoicism and fitness, with the variability in pulmonary function on testing correlating well with a slight increase in the frequency of his occasional episodes, because of the asthma and allergies, he may benefit from Singulair.



Probable mild occult gastroesophageal reflux.



Ischemic coronary disease, status post VF arrest and revascularization.



Myasthenia, mainly ocular.



Prior Raynaud's syndrome.



Recommendations:



Continue Advair at the current dose.



Trial of Singulair, 10 mg p.o. q. p.m.



Low threshold for adding a proton-pump inhibitor and/or intranasal steroids.



Continue exercise program.



Return visit in three months with pulmonary function tests at that time.



It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.



Sincerely yours,







Dean S. Nye, M.D.

S:   (1)  Patient here complaining of increased neck pain with paresthesias of her

          left arm and tingling of her third and fourth left fingers.  This often

          occurs at the end of the week, when has been at the computer all week

          and then has to take her Vioxx and Norflex for the next two or three

          days, into the weekend.  Patient becoming very frustrated regarding this.

          Did not keep follow-up with Dr. Espinosa, the neurosurgeon she

          initially saw. 



     (2)  Diabetes: Patient had her first eye exam yesterday with Dr. Dunn, who

          actually is an optometrist.  He is referring her to a retinal specialist, due

          to a question of cystoid macular edema, due to diabetic retinopathy and

          some possible borderline intraocular pressures.  The patient is very

          concerned regarding this. Is worried about her heart and kidneys, now

          that she is having problems with her eyes.  Is trying to stick to her diet,

          but is worried. Blood sugars at home have been mostly in the 200's,

          occasionally high 100's. Patient does not bring her record with her. 



O:   Patient refuses to be weighed. BP, RA sitting 128/90. Lungs: Clear to A&P.

     COR: AP 96, NSR. Positive tenderness and spasm to left trapezius muscle.

     Feet: No lesions. Dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ bilaterally.  



A/P: (1)  Chronic neck and shoulder pain with intermittent paresthesias, with

          MRI showing some chronic degenerative changes, but also mild

          impingement of the subarachnoid space, possibly even at the cord at C5-6.

          Lengthy discussion with patient regarding this being chronic problem

          and need to follow up with Dr. Espinosa.  Will refer to P.T., not only

          for therapy, but also to re-evaluate ergonomics of her work site, as this

          may help. Continue all other medications, with ice, heat and home

          exercises.  Consulted with Dr. Moses, who suggested a TENS Unit may

          be helpful.  Will discuss further with patient. 



     (2)  AODM: Now with diabetic retinopathy. Lengthy discussion of 20 to 30

          minutes with patient regarding implications of this, as well as need for

          better diabetic control, especially, as poorly-controlled diabetes is quietly

          harming both her heart and her kidneys, as well as her blood vessels. 

          Patient seems more motivated now to try to adhere to diet and exercise.

          Refer to Dr. Larry Kowalski, a retinal specialist, as soon as possible. Patient

          promises to do her bloodwork for her RFT's, fasting lipids, FBS,

          hemoglobin A1C, as well as urine microalbumin.  Will follow up with

          Dr. Moses and with me afterwards.

EDVISIT^46103196^HART, MATTHEW^06/14/79^NAPOLITANO, URSULA

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old male

with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,

history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, and

DVT on Coumadin who comes in to the ER because he has recently

missed dialysis appointment and he feels increased abdominal

girth and shortness of breath.  He said that his father has been

sick, so he has been spending a significant amount of time

helping him and because of that had a short dialysis on Wednesday

and missed his Friday dialysis run.  Today is Sunday and he

generally gets dialysis on Sunday as well.  When I asked if he

has been having chest pain, he says he has not had chest pain,

but he did have a tickling in his chest that lasted seconds and

was not accompanying with any diaphoresis or radiation of the

pain.  Even he was ambulatory into the ED, he had no chest pain

when he was exerting himself.  He does feel slightly increased

shortness of breath and worse when he walks around, but he thinks

that because of increased fluids.  He has had no fevers or

chills, no lightheadedness, no nausea, vomiting and no diarrhea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,

coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis,

diabetes, DVT on Coumadin, hypertension, bladder cancer,

substance abuse and GERD.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  AV fistula in 01/2078.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, rare alcohol and occasional cocaine

use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Breast cancer and prostate cancer.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As mentioned in HPI, otherwise negative.

MEDICATIONS:  Reviewed, please see the list.

ALLERGIES:  Include cephalosporin and simvastatin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.3, heart rate 92,

respiratory rate 28, blood pressure 155/84 and O2 saturation 100%

on room air.  The patient is awake, alert, talking in complete

sentences, appears to be mildly uncomfortable.  ENT:  Atraumatic.

 Neck:  Normal to inspection, supple.  Chest:  Clear to

auscultation bilaterally, no rales.  Cardiovascular:  Regular

rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Minimal

distention, soft.  No focal tenderness.  Skin is intact. 

Extremities:  No lower extremity swelling or edema, no calf

tenderness bilaterally.  Neuropsychiatric:  Oriented x3.  Cranial

nerves II through XII tested and intact.  No motor or sensory

deficits.  Gait is normal.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient received an EKG, which

showed normal sinus rhythm.  No significant ST or T

abnormalities, no significant peaked T waves are consistent with

his previous EKG.  PA lateral chest x-ray showed no evidence of

acute cardiopulmonary infiltrates.  Only labs which resulted

initially were CBC, which showed a hematocrit of 33.2, platelets

423,000 and white count of 6.74.  We made contact with the renal

fellow who recommended that we proceed dialysis while the

dialysis unit still open and we felt that it was safe for this

patient.  His potassium was not back at the time that he left the

department, however, he was well appearing and had no arrhythmias

on the monitor and we think that his tickling chest sensation is

very atypical for cardiac symptom, not being, so we will reassess

when he comes back and likely check a second troponin to be sure

that this is unlikely to be acute coronary syndrome.  After he

left the department, additional labs came back include INR of 2.1

and a Chem-7 showing a sodium of 142, a potassium of 6.4, a

chloride of 102, bicarbonate of 21, BUN of 106, creatinine 6.18,

glucose of 195, CK of 157, troponin of less than 0.04, calcium

8.6, phosphorus of 5.1, and magnesium of 2.3 and promptly called

the renal fellow who was aware of the elevated potassium and have

the patient on the monitor in the Dialysis Unit and agreed to

treat him there acutely.  Again after the dialysis, the patient

will return to the Emergency Department.  We will reassess if

symptoms and see how he feels, check a second cardiac enzymes. 

If he feels significantly improved and he continues to have no

chest pain, we feel that his symptoms are likely atypical for

acute coronary syndrome and we also called that this was not

acute coronary syndrome if two troponins are not elevated and he

will be able to follow up and resume his regular dialysis

schedule.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Volume overload.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis.

DISPOSITION:  Pending.

Please see ED note for further ED course.  This was a shared

visit with resident physician, Dr. Adam Mcclure.

History of Presenting Illness
Mr. Egan is a 72 year old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and Type II DM. Two weeks ago, he noted intermittent episodes of exertional dyspnea. He was started on albuterol and advair with no improvement. On 08/30/2135, he experienced worsening exertional shortness of breath and mild chest discomfort. He sought medical attention at Natchaug Hospital ED. An initial ECG revealed Q waves in V1-V4. He ruled in for an myocardial infarction with a troponin on 2.0. He was found to be in congestive heart failure. He was given plavix, aspirin, lovenox and IV lasix with improvement in symptoms. 
On 08/31/2135, he was transferred to Gibson Community Hospital for cardiac catheterization. The results were significant for multivessel coronary artery disease and moderate mitral valve regurgitation with an left ventricular ejection fraction of 25 to 30%. He was referred to Dr. Sebastian Dang for elective cardiac surgical revascularization and possible mitral valve repair. He was discharged to home on 09/02/2135. 
On 09/03/2135, he developed recurrent left sided chest pressure while at rest. He took 2 SL TNG with improvement in symptoms. He presented to Gibson Community Hospital ED. He was started on IV heparin. Initial cardiac biomarkers were negative. He was found to have an elevated BNP to 2817. A CXR showed congestive heart failure. He was admitted to CAU. He had an episode of chest pressure while at rest that resolved with 1 SL TNG. He is being referred for consideration of cardiac surgery.

FERRARA, LAUREN

48185437

03/10/2067



MAJOR DIAGNOSIS:  Lung mass.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Lauren is a 75-year-old woman.  She has only a very remote history of smoking, smoking not at all after the age of 30.  In early March, she was undergoing a routine physical.  At that time, she reported she had some mild weight loss.  However, she had been trying to lose weight.  She had no respiratory symptoms of dyspnea or cough.  A chest x-ray was obtained, which revealed a 6 cm left lung mass.  The patient subsequently had a CT scan.  The CT scan revealed a 4 x 6 lung mass in the posterior subsegment of the right upper lobe.  There were some modestly enlarged hilar nodes, but all below 2 cm.  She has some tiny sub 5 mm nodules in both lungs.  The patient is referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Jordon for further evaluation.  The patient has no history of lung .  She has no history of asthma or allergies.  She has not had any history of TB or a positive PPD.  She may have had some mild asbestos exposure when she worked in a publishing company, which had asbestos containing pipes.  She has no history of malignancy.  She has no avocational exposures to dust or danders.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes:

1.  Mild vascular dementia.

2.  Hypertension.

3.  Hyperlipidemia.

4.  Diabetes.

5.  Hypothyroidism.

6.  Peripheral vascular disease.

7.  Anemia.

8.  Renal artery stenosis with mild renal failure.

9.  Carotid artery stenosis.



MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl 88 mcg a day, Plavix 75 mg a day, Aricept 10 mg a day, furosemide 20 mg a day, nifedipine 90 mg a day, Crestor 20 mg a day, metoprolol 25 mg a day, calcium, Zetia 10 mg a day, vitamin D, Nephrocaps 1 mg a day, fish oil, aspirin 81 mg a day.



ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and estrogens and red dye #5.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband.  She does not drink.  She has a very remote smoking history in her teens and early 20s.



FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is in no distress.  Her O2 saturation is 95%.  Her blood pressure is 130/70, her pulse is 53.  Head and neck exam:  She is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Her nares are without discharge.  Oropharynx with dentures.  She has no erythema or exudate.  Neck is supple without adenopathy, thyromegaly, or bruits.  Her thorax is kyphotic.  She has normal fremitus and percussion.  Her lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam:  No JVD, S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs.  Abdomen is soft.  Extremities have no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  She has residual of vascular surgery in her legs.  She has slightly diminished peripheral pulses.



LABORATORY DATA:  Spirometry is normal.



IMAGING STUDIES:  A chest CT is as noted.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  A 75-year-old with a large right lung mass.  This is likely to be malignant, although a nonmalignant process or inflammatory processes are remotely possible.  At this point, I am going to refer her for a PET CT scan.  Her small nodules in her lung fields bilaterally are all sub 5mm and may not be related to this malignancy.  She does have modestly enlarged hilar nodes.  I am going to refer her to Thoracic Surgery for consideration of a mediastinoscopy and potential resection.  She would likely require cardiac clearance before this would occur.  She can follow up with me after her surgery if this proves to be an inflammatory lung disorder.  Otherwise, she will follow up with Oncology.  If she was deemed not to be an appropriate surgical candidate, either because of metastatic disease or because of comorbidity, she could have this lesion biopsied via a transthoracic needle aspirate.

HPI:  Kadeem Vicente comes in today for follow up office visit.  The patient 
is seen primarily for follow up regarding his history of hypertension, 
coronary artery disease (the patient is status post inferior wall MI), 
benign prostatic hypertrophy and to a much lesser extent osteoarthritis.  
The patient is also followed GERD-like symptoms.  With regard to the 
latter, the patient notes that since he has been off the Zantac, he 
initially saw no change in his ability to handle foods; however, he now 
notes that he is starting to get some reflux and feels slightly 
uncomfortable with this.  He denies chest pain per se and any symptoms 
pertinent to cardiovascular disease, such as chest heaviness, shortness 
of breath, diaphoresis, nausea.  The patient knows the foods that give 
him this type of reaction, such as tomato based sauces and tries to 
avoid them as much as possible.  The patient is asking me about Prilosec 
which he recently read in the Journal and was wandering whether this 
would be a suitable alternative to H2 blockers (Patient had been on H2 
blockers for many years without a trial off of them, which a reason that 
we stopped his H2 blocker therapy recently).  
 
With regard to the patient's symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, 
the patient says that these have almost completely resolved on the 4 mg 
of Hytrin and which he will continue taking.  The patient does remain on 
Zestril for his hypertension as well as the Hytrin and the blood 
pressure gotten by the nurse today was 150/80 and repeated by me 20 
minutes later was 130/74. 
 
The patient reports being otherwise well, no new symptoms.  No positive 
review of systems.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Was not performed.  Vitals:  Blood pressure taken by me 
was 130/74 in the right, 130/74 in the left, temperature was 98.8, 
respirations 20, unlabored and pulse was 80.  
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  75 year old man with multiple medical concerns 
comes in for follow up.
1.   Hypertension.  The patient will stay on his Zestril, once a day as 
     well as his Hytrin, which he uses also for BPH.  His blood pressure 
     appears to be well controlled on this regimen.  One of the issues 
     would be whether or not the patient should be on a beta-blocker.  
     The patient verbally has a history of ""a silent heart attack""  and 
     there is evidence of an inferior wall MI and this is certainly an 
     option we will consider in the future, although I would not add a 
     third anti-hypertensive regimen and would most likely replace his 
     Zestril with a beta-blocker.
2.   GERD.  The patient will be given a prescription for Prilosec 20 mg 
     to be taken at bedtime.  The patient was told that this would not

     be long term therapy but that we can do this for the next 2-3 
     months, although he should be able to experience relief almost 
     immediately.  The patient does have a known hiatal hernia, which 
     may also contribute to his symptoms of chronic reflux.
3.   BPH - The patient will stay on his 4 mg of Hytrin, which appears to 
     be working quite well.  The patient notes that there is less 
     dribbling, less nocturnal urination.  The patient does take Lasix 
     20 mg once a day for congestive heart failure and did not have any 
     difficulty with urination after he takes the diuretic.  
4.   Insomnia.  The patient will stay on his Ambien 10 mg which he takes 
     on a q.h.s. basis.  The patient was formerly on Amitriptyline but 
     was told that the secondary side effects which can include EKG 
     changes and at this point tells me that the Ambien works and he 
     would like to stay on this.  Patient has enough to last until I see 
     him next time.
 
I will thus see the patient in 3 months for a fasting lipid (The 
patient's lipid profile thus far has been acceptable.   The cholesterol 
is 190 and an acceptable triglyceride; however, I do want to assess the 
patient's LDL and HDL before making any decisions with regard to 
treatment.

CARDIOLOGY

PERHAM MERITCARE CLINIC



Reason for visit:

   Ms. Neill came into the emergency room even though she was feeling fine because she insists that she wanted to see me today even though it is not an office day.  She was instructed to come to the office and I was able to see her in between catheterization cases



Interval History:

   Ms. Neill was recently evaluated at Janesville Clinic for her dyspnea.  She was concerned that her dyspnea was related to her lungs and I believe self referred to Janesville for further evaluation.  



She was found by cardiac echo there to have significant decrease in her ejection fraction to 15%.  Previously here last fall her ejection fraction measured 43%.  She had global hypokinesis.



She was hospitalized at Janesville and had an abnormal set of pulmonary function tests showing moderate restrictive disease.  She had some air trapping and was noted to have room air saturation 97% at rest, 94% with exertion.  Lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT.  d dimer 400 rnage.  BNP elevated at 500.  VQ scan showed possible perfusion defect in the left lower lobe.  Previous CTA in the emergency room had been negative for pulmonary embolus.  Because of continued suspicion about PE she underwent pulmonary arterogram which was unremarkable.  A repeat VQ scan after a normal PA gram showed some persistence in the left lower lobe defect and ultimately it was felt that she did not have evidence of any thromboembolic pulmonary vascular disease.  Of note pulmonary artery pressure was approximately 50 at the time of PA gram.



The patient was commenced on Lasix 20mg.  Her Atenolol was changed to Toprol.



Unfortunately she does not bring with her a complete list of her medications today although she relates that she is taking:

Lasix 20mg

Toprol XL 50mg

ASA 325mg

Zestril 20mg

Lantus 10 units hs

Glucovance 2.5/500mg

Multivitamin



She relates that her dyspnea is better



She is extremely reluctant to undergo Cardiac catheterization at this time despite recommendation on my part.  She would much prefer cardiac echo and if there is improvement, continued medical therapy.





Past medical history:

   1. Diabetes

2. Hypertension

3. Hyperlipidemia

4. Sick Sinus syndrome requiring permanant pacemaker

5. cardiomypathy

6. Minimal CAD by cath 2090



Family history:

   No significant cardiac disease



Social history:

   She and her husband are doing well.  She has retired. Daughter is finished with college and Quarry Worker in the Bristow area.



Review of systems:

   Patinet is improved with regard to exertional tolerance as noted.  Denies edema, PND, orthopnea.  Still has dyspnea with walking flat ground but not until 1-2 blocks.



Physical examination:

-BP: 130/80  

-General appearance:   No acute distress.

-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.

-Heent:   Unremarkable

-Neck:   CVP 8.  No carotid bruits

-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.

-Cardiac:   S1 S2.   No significant murmurs.  PMI normal.

-Abdomen:   Obese, soft, no hepatosplenomegly

-Extremities:   Good pulses, no edema

-Neuro:   Non-focal

-Pulse: 89  



EKG:

   Atrial triggered ventricular pacing with borderline first degree AV block.



Impression:

   Ms. Neill is very reluctant regarding angiography despite a drop in her ejection fraction.



Her evaluation at Janesville Clinic for thromboembolic pulmonary disease was unremarkable.



She was found to have a markedly positive ANA at 1-1280 with a speckled pattern and single stranded DNA postive.  Further markers etc are not available to me at this time.



At this point, repeat cardiac echo at our institution will be obtained.



Depending upon the results I will again approach the patient regarding considering Cardiac catheterization although in truth her pattern in LV dysfunction is more suggestive of recurrent myocarditis/undetermined cardiomyopathy than coronary disease.



In addition, the patient relates that she stopped Lipitor due to myalgia and that she is taking a differrent cholesterol tablet at this time although once again she unable to name the medication.  She relates that she will call our office.

History of present illness

			

  Oneill was hospitalized at the Muscatine Health Center shortly after leaving the YCH following his catheterization and placement of the stent by Dr.  Hall.  Because of the recurrent chest pain at Muscatine Health he was catheterized again from the left groin and the stent seemed to be functioning normally.  He was given the usual supportive therapy and discharged.  He is now taking Isordil 30 mg SR daily as isosorbide mononitrate.  He takes metoprolol 25 mg one-half BID, Procardia XL 30 mg daily, furosemide 20 mg per day, K-Dur 20 mEq daily, Flomax 0.4 mg daily, Singulair 10 mg daily, Advair 25/50 mg daily, Prilosec 20 mg per day, terazosin 10 mg per day, and atorvastatin 10 mg HS.  He states that he feels completely well.  He has noted good healing in the left groin.  No new issues.

Fayetteville, MI  31474                             94859580
                                              12-18-93
 
 
 
HPI:  Mr. Vicente returns for follow-up.  He is status post TURP by Dr. 
Nixon.  He is having a little bit of incontinence, but Dr. Nixon 
thinks that this should get better.
 
We will have to recheck his platelets, which have been in the 120 to 145 
range.  We also will look back at his echocardiogram, which is showing 
that he had slight mitral and tricuspid regurgitation as well as mildly 
dilated LV with inferior hypokinesis.  He has remained on digoxin status 
post his myocardial infarction.
 
We want to recheck his cholesterol today.  We also have been concerned 
that he has been a little depressed but mostly because he is concerned 
about his wife's situation with breast cancer.  We had a long discussion 
about this.
 
Physical Examination:  On physical examination, his weight is 250 lbs.  
His blood pressure was 178/80.  The follow-up was 170/80.  His neck was 
supple.  Chest was clear to both percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac 
exam was regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen 
was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities were 
clear of cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Rectal tone was normal and guaiac 
negative.
 
Laboratory Data:  His hematocrit was 39.9.  Platelets were within normal 
limits.  White count is 8.3.  Digoxin is 0.9.  Lytes are within normal 
limits.  
 
Assessment and Plan:
1.   Status post TURP.  He appears to be recovering well.  He has had 
     slight incontinence, but I suspect this will pass.
2.   Thrombocytopenia.  This was very relative.  It now appears to have 
     resolved.
3.   Coronary artery disease.  As he recovers from his TURP, I question 
     whether it might be reasonable to go ahead and reexercise him.  At 
     the present time, he is quite stable on an aspirin, digoxin and 
     Lasix.  However, it may be that he would benefit from further 
     treatment with anti-anginals.
4.   Hypercholesterolemia.  This has been well-controlled recently.  His 
     last cholesterol was 168 in August of 2093.
5.   Depression.  He continues on Ambien.  He has some discretion about 
     his wife's breast cancer, and he appears to have some of his 
     uncertainty resolved.

For his pre-operative work-up, the patient had a stress PET exam on 3/26 that was notable for a medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior and inferolateral walls that was reversible. As a result, the patient was referred to Dr. Carroll who saw the patient in clinic on 3/27. Given the patient's risk factors and positive stress test, the patient was scheduled for right and left heart catheterization on the day of admission with the plan to delay his hip surgery if he requires a stent and subsequent Plavix therapy. On the evening prior to his catheterization, he had dialysis.
 
The patient went to the cath lab where he was found to have an 80% lesion of the mid-RCA so a bare-metal stent was placed. After cath, the patient was started on ASA 325mg PO daily and Plavix loaded with 600mg PO x 1 then 75mg PO daily thereafter.

Persistent cough



HPI:



Ms. Edgar is a 64 year-old frequently hospitalized woman with CHFpEF (EF = 71%), COPD on 2.5L home O2 and chronic steroids (currently 10 mg prednisone), OSA on BiPAP, CKD, and chronic pain on chronic narcotics, who presents with persistent cough productive of green sputum after recently being treated for influenza.  According to the patient, she left the hospital, completed the course of Tamiflu and azithromycin on 2/24, and continued to feel poorly, with a chronic nagging cough that was productive of dark green sputum. 
No fever, chills, sweats, myalgias, or SOB.  Yesterday, she developed worsening pain, especially in her ribs, extending across the anterior surface; she said the pain is worse with movement but does not vary with respiration or cough.  She is unable to ambulate, as she states she does at baseline with a walker.  



This is her tenth hospital and fourteenth ED visit to MCH in the past year (there are records in the chart of OSH visits as well).  On interview she is tearful regarding her readmission, stating that she &#8220;tries so hard&#8221; to stay out of the hospital, &#8220;but what am I supposed to do when I am sick?&#8221;



ED Course:



In the ED, a CXR showed a RLL patchy opacity suggestive of pneumonia. She received 750 mg levofloxacin, 1 g vancomycin, nebulizer treatments, and morphine for pain control.  



ROS



On interview, she endorses only rib pain and back and hip pain that she says is chronic from her spinal stenosis.  She also complains of the chronic cough described above.  No CP, SOB, dysuria, pyuria, N/V/D.



MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY 



- Influenza: Recently discharged on 2/22/2124 after being diagnosed with influenza A.  She was treated with nebulizers, tamiflu, and azithromycin for 5 days.

ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN



64 year-old morbidly obese woman with DM2, OSA, COPD on 2.5L home O2, OSA, recently treated for influenza A, presents with persistent cough productive of green sputum and rib pain.



#)  Productive cough: Has leukocytosis and haziness especially on lateral CXR.  In the absence of other symptoms (new O2 requirement, SOB, pleuritic chest pain, fevers/chills), a diagnosis of pneumonia is difficult to make.  However, she is on chronic steroids and narcotics at baseline and may not mount a typical symptomatic response.

-        Continue HAP coverage started in ED (vanc+cef)
 for seven days
-        Respiratory cultures ordered



#)  Multiple re-hospitalizations: as above, she has been admitted at ten times in the past year just to MCH alone.  A viable long-term plan for outpatient management is essential.

      -  Consider complex care committee consult this admission



#)  Prophy:  Fragmin 5000; senna+colace; H2 blocker (given chronic steroid use)



#)  F/E/N: regular diet.

Infectious Disease Fellow Consult Note



Patient Name:  Yerger, Urania

MRN:  58348900

HPI:  Ms. Yerger is an 84 yo F with CAD, DM, CHF, Htn, HL, and right ankle fracture s/p ORIF on 11/04/81 who presents with poor healing over the medial malleolus; we were consulted by Dr. Felton for recommendations on antibiotic management.   



She was initially seen on 11/01/81 after a mechanical fall which resulted in comminuted bimalleolar ankle fracture for which she underwent ORIF on 11/04/81.  She had follow-up with her orthopaedist on 1/15/81 at which time she was noted to have an eschar with poor wound healing around the medial malleolus.  She was therefore admitted yesterday for I&D of the open lesion on her ankle, as well as hardware removal.  There is no operative report from the procedure.  Reportedly there was non-union of the fracture, so hardware was removed.  Tissue appeared fairly healthy.   

 

She denies having any recent fevers, chills, night sweats, or particular pain in the ankle.  She has been doing some weight bearing with use of a walker.  She has had some mild serous drainage from the ankle, but no purulent drainage.

Impression/Recommendations: 84 yo F with CAD, DM, CHF, Htn, HL, and right ankle fracture s/p ORIF on 11/04/81 who presents with poor healing over the medial malleolus, now s/p I&D of the open medial malleolus wound; we were consulted by Dr. Felton for recommendations on antibiotic management.   



The extent of infection is a surgical diagnosis.  If the swabs were obtained from the superficial wound, then this may represent merely a wound infection which requires 2 weeks of antibiotics.  However if the infection was felt on surgical inspection to extend to the region of the removed hardware, then this represents osteomyelitis by definition, and she will need 6 weeks of IV antibiotics with consideration of the removal of the remaining hardware.  



After discussion with the ortho resident, it seems that the culture was obtained from the site of screw removal.  Thus, we have to assume hardware infection with concomitant osteomyelitis.  Thus 6 weeks of IV antibiotics is necessary.  We cannot rule out infection of the remaining hardware, however I understand the reluctance to remove the remainder of the hardware by the ortho service.  Thus would pursue 6 week course of therapy, then monitor closely for signs of failure. 



1.	Continue vancomycin until susceptibilities are available; will determine whether the addition of rifampin in necessary given retained hardware based on susceptibility results

2.     Please obtain vanc trough prior to 3rd dose

3.     Please obtain LFTs

 

Patient seen and examined with ID Attending, Dr. Ulysses Xayasane.  

We will continue to follow along with you.  Thank you for the consult.

Dear Nurse Rivas, 




We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.  The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Isaac Ferraro. 





Ruath Doss is a 60yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, hypercholesterolemia, and G6PD deficiency who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.  She had recovered well from her strokes, and has been seizure-free for two years on Dilantin.  She was last seen here in December 2091. 
Since that visit, she has had several significant health-related events: her breast biopsy was found to be negative, and she also underwent clipping of her incidentally found L ACA aneurysm via bifrontal craniotomy.  Dr. Gertrude Fulton performed this procedure in February which was uneventful.  However, an abdominal aortic aneurysm was found on an ultrasound for abdominal pain (attributed to biliary colic), so she is being followed for increase in size of the aneurysm as well as for any new cerebral aneurysms.  



Mrs. Doss still has some occasional burning pain over her right incision site, helpd with rubbing the area.  She had some bilateral lateral thigh numbness after the surgery, a recrudescence of old symptoms which improved after a bowel movement but which have not yet completely resolved.  She denies any recent seizures.  After discussing the results of the bone densitometry test with you, it was decided that she did not need additional calcium agents.

Gait:  Posture, stance, stride, and arm-swing normal. Able to walk on heels and toes. Tandem gait intact. Romberg negative. 





Assessment and Recommendations:



60yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.  Her clinical examination remains intact.  She has been seizure free for two years at this point, including through intracranial surgery, and she is amenable to a trial of tapering off the Dilantin.  Given that her seizures occurred within a week of her stroke, and that her EEG at that time did not show epileptiform discharges, she is a good candidate for AED discontinuation.  Before doing so, we will obtain a baseline EEG to assess for cortical irritability.  Such an abnormality may be difficult to detect given her craniotomy; if the breech is significant, she would be a candidate for a MEG study.  If there are no epileptiform discharges, we can institute a taper off the Dilantin (decrease by 100mg every 5 days).  After she has been off the Dilantin for two weeks, we will again repeat an EEG.  She is aware that she will not be able to drive for 6 months after the Dilantin is stopped, and that there is an increased risk of seizures especially in the first 3 months.  



We discussed the importance of weight loss, as well as continued good diabetic, hypertensive, and lipid control for stroke prevention.  The weight loss will likely help resolve her meralgia paresthetica as well.  (It is not entirely clear how the constipation related to her symptoms.)  Given the new irregularity on her most recent carotid ultrasound, we will repeat the study once more to ensure that there has been no progression.  Mrs. Doss will call me after her EEG and carotid ultrasound have been completed so that we can discuss the results, and also to determine whether to taper off the Dilantin.  



Of note, Dr. Isaac Ferraro was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam. Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.  Thank you for allowing us to continue to participate in the care of your patient.  As I am graduating from the residency program, she will be seen by a different resident in 6 months time.     





Sincerely,

IDENTIFICATION:  A 65-year-old woman presents as a new patient to discuss problems with leg swelling.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

1.  Longstanding insulin-dependent adult onset diabetes with a history of neuropathy and retinopathy.

2.  History of lower extremity edema with past evaluation per patient including a normal stress echocardiogram.

3.  History of low back pain due to degenerative disc disease.  The patient has been treated at the Bryan W Whitfield Memorial Hospital  with treatments including facet blocks and epidural injections.

4.  Status post cholecystectomy.

5.  Status post four vaginal deliveries, two cesarean sections and two miscarriages.

8.  Hypothyroidism.

9.  Former smoker approximately 15-pack-year history quit seven years ago.

10.  Hypertension.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient has a longstanding history of diabetes.  She has required retinal laser surgery for retinopathy.  She reports some tingling and numbness in the bottom of her feet.  She has had debilitating problems with lower extremity swelling over the last 18 months.  She notes that an extensive evaluation was initially done without a clear explanation.  Her endocrinologist had her stop her Actos which resulted in significant improvement.  Over the last six months, however, the patient has developed leg swelling again.  She denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  She does note some exertional shortness of breath, which she attributes to her weight.  She has no history of exertional chest pain.  She has not noted a change in her abdominal girth.  She has had no calf pain or swelling.  She does note a history of sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome.  The patient notes that she had a sleep study at some point in the past two or three years ago.  A CPAP device was recommended but not tolerated by the patient.  She notes that she has significant daily low back pain.  Her average pain is 8-9/10.  This occurs while she is standing or walking any distance.  She has very little or no pain when she is sitting or lying.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, unremarkable with no fever, chills, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, black or bloody stools, dysuria, skin rash.  The patient does have exertional leg cramps.  She notes a vascular evaluation was normal and her pain was felt due to her back.



MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc 5 mg q.d., Bextra 20 mg q.d., Lipitor 20 mg q.d., lisinopril 40 mg q.d., atenolol 50 mg q.d., Flonase one spray each nostril q.d., quinine 324 mg q.h.s. p.r.n., aspirin 81 mg q.d., insulin, Humulin N 40 units b.i.d., Humalog sliding scale 15 to 25 units q.a.m. 15 to 25 units before dinner, levothyroxine 150 mcg q.a.m.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: Weight 284 pounds, temperature 98.2, heart rate 68, blood pressure 140/64.  The patient is in no distress, breathing comfortably.  HEENT: Anicteric, no oral lesions.  Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no thyroid mass or nodule.  Lungs: Clear to auscultation.  No wheeze, rales or rhonchi.  Cardiac: Regular.  Distant heart sounds.  No murmur, rub or gallop.  Abdomen: Obese, soft, no mass.  Normoactive bowel tones.  Extremities: 2+ edema to the knees.  Vascular: Carotid pulses are strong and symmetric without bruit.  Radial, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are strong and symmetric.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

1.  Edema.  The patient's edema is likely multifactorial.  She does not have evidence of congestive heart failure today.  I reviewed her dietary sodium intake, which sounds to be acceptable.  She may benefit from additional nutrition counseling regarding this issue.  Her leg swelling may also relate to her Norvasc use.  I did not see her urine microalbumin testing and laboratory studies the patient brings with her today.  Significant proteinuria may be contributing to her edema as well.  The patient has had no reactions to sulfa medications and has never been on a thiazide diuretic to her knowledge.  I recommended initially that she stop the Norvasc and start hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d.  I discussed the use and side effects of this medication.  I will see her back in the office in two or three weeks to review her progress.

2.  Low back pain. I recommend the patient continue her Bextra.  We discussed other pain medications including narcotics.  We elected against using these medications today.

3.  History of sleep apnea.  The patient has significant fatigue.  This may be due to her sleep apnea.  In addition, her difficulty with her weight as well as fluid retention may relate to her poorly controlled sleep apnea.  I discussed this with her today.  I would recommend that she return for a follow up sleep study.  She did not have good luck with a sleep mask but might do better with a nasal mask.  She will think about this and we will review it again on her follow up visit.

  RE:  Adler, Imogene

  MRN: 618-13-82-6

  

  

  Dear Dr. Yingling:

  

  Thank you for referring your patient, Imogene Adler,

  for her problem of coronary ischemia.  As you know, Ms.

  Adler is a 49 year old woman with four years of

  essential hypertension and mild dyslipidemia who is

  postmenopausal and has noticed increasing symptoms of chest

  tightness associated with exertion.  A stress MIBI SPECT

  study ordered by you demonstrated inferolateral mid and

  basal inferior ischemia consistent with a left circumflex

  distribution.  The details of the study include an exercise

  protocol for which the patient exercised for 7 minutes and

  15 seconds for 8.9 mets, with an increase in heart rate from

  74 to 159 (which is 94% of predicted peak heart rate), and

  increase in blood pressure from 134/80 to 210/80 (with a

  rate pressure product of 33,390).  The test was stopped due

  to fatigue and moderately severe chest pain.  EKG

  demonstrated 1.5mm of upsloping depression in II, III, F and

  V4-V5, and there were no noted arrhythmias.  

  

  Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable and her

  current medications include estrogen, Premarin, Provera, and

  verapamil 240mg q.d.  A recent lipid panel demonstrated a

  total cholesterol of 203, LDL of 142, and an HDL of 39.

  

  On physical examination, she is comfortable, well appearing

  woman with a weight of 186 pounds, pulse 68 beats per minute

  and regular, blood pressure 140/82 in the left arm.  Jugular

  venous pressure was approximately 6-8cm of water.  Carotids

  demonstrates normal upstroke with no bruits.  Chest

  examination was clear to auscultation.  Heart examination

  demonstrated a normal S1, positive S4, physiologically split

  S2, no murmurs or rubs.  Abdominal examination was 

  

  

  RE:  Adler, Imogene

  unremarkable.  Peripheral examination demonstrated no

  peripheral examination and 2+ bilateral peripheral pulses.  

  

  EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and otherwise normal

  EKG.  

  

  I reviewed the findings suggestive of an obstructive

  coronary lesion in the left circumflex distribution and the

  probability of her having single vessel coronary artery

  disease as the culprit for her chest pain.  We reviewed the

  options which include medical therapy and/or coronary

  angiography and possible angioplasty.  I made no solid

  recommendations for her, but suggested that the angioplasty

  approach was a relatively low risk approach which may lead

  to curing the obstructive lesion as opposed to medical

  therapy, which would also be a well supported decision, and

  I reviewed the evidence to suggest medical treatment of

  single vessel disease does not shorten one's life span and

  only affects the quality of life depending on the symptom

  tolerance.  She and her husband are going to reflect on

  these recommendations and get back to me by the end of the

  week.  If she does decide to undergo coronary angiography

  and possible angioplasty, we will schedule her immediately

  in Cardiology.

  

  I have scheduled follow-up in one month regardless to see

  her in the office.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if

  I can be of any further assistance.

  

  With warm regards,

RE:  Kathy Joshi
     ILC #158-42-11-2
 
Dear Dr. Taylor:
 
Mrs. Joshi returns after a one year hiatus.  She continues to
complain of rare retrosternal chest discomfort only occasionally
secondary to exertion.  These episodes occur on a roughly once a
month basis lasting anywhere from seconds to several minutes. 
Addition of long acting nitrates to her medical regimen has had no
effect on the frequency or severity of this syndrome and she does
not take Nitroglycerin for it.  A stress test performed last
January showed Mrs. Joshi exercising for 4 minutes and 30 seconds
of a Bruce protocol stopping at a peak heart rate of 119, peak
blood pressure of 150/70 secondary to dyspnea.  She had no ischemic
EKG changes noted, however, a simultaneously obtained Sesta-MIBI
scan revealed a minor fixed anterior wall defect as well as a small
surrounding area of transient ischemia.  In addition, there was a
moderately severe fixed inferior wall defect again with peri-
infarct mild ischemia.  Of note, her last serum cholesterol was 266
with an HDL of 52 and an LDL of 192. 
 
She remains on a regimen of Isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d.,
aspirin 1 tab p.o. q.d, Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., NPH 12 units
S.C. q a.m. with 6 units CZI S.C. q a.m., and 15 units NPH S.C. q
p.m.. 
 
Physical exam reveals a well nourished, overweight woman in no
acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 160/90, heart
rate 67 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 264
pounds, which is six pounds above her weight of one year ago.  The
neck is supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2 + without bruits.  Chest
 
                             Page 2

remains clear.  Cardiac exam reveals normal S1, physiologically
split S2 and a soft I/VI systolic ejection murmur.  The abdomen is
benign.  Extremities without appreciable edema.  
 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 67, P-R interval
.22, QRS .10, Q-T .36, axis 20 degrees.  There are isolated atrial
premature depolarizations noted along with first degree AV block
and a prior inferior posterior myocardial infarction with minor
nonspecific ST and T wave changes.  Compared to his last
electrocardiogram there has been no significant change.
 
Impression:  Mrs. Joshi continues to have evidence of mild, stable
angina.  I have asked her to begin Simvastatin at 20 mg p.o. q h.s.
for her significant hyperlipidemia and I strongly encouraged her to
more aggressively try to lower her caloric intake and increase her
aerobic activity level.  In addition, I have asked her to obtain
her blood pressure at least two or three more times on an
ambulatory basis and told her that if she remained reliably above
140/85 then I would consider initiating pharmacologic
antihypertensive therapy.  In addition, as long as she remains
active and asymptomatic, I will plan on repeating her exercise MIBI
stress test in one to one and a half years time.  Beyond this I
have not altered her present regimen. 
 
Of course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in her care.
 
Respectfully yours,

Visit Note



Patient Name: WILSON, GABRIEL                        MRN: 8514931

Dictated Date: 06/29/2097                      Dictated By: Julie Fraser, M.D.



Date of Visit: 06/28/2097





 Patient is a 76-year-old Croatian woman who came in today. Her daughter Gibbs was translating. She is a very complicated 76-year-old Croatian woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, vertebral basilar insufficiency, chronic hepatitis B and other medical problems. She is status post a right Bell's palsy in the past. 



Recently she has been sometimes living at her daughter's house and other times at her niece's house. They are trying to provide more support in terms of regulating that she takes her medication. When she stays at her daughter's Gibbs's house her daughter does check her sugars though her niece does not. Her blood pressure has been very labile recently and we recently added hydrochlorothiazide and nifedipine extended release 30 mg every day to her regimen in addition to her regular Cozaar and Toprol. Her daughter also has increased her insulin/70/30 to 48 units in the morning. She thinks that sometimes in the afternoon or late afternoon she may have some low sugars. She reports that her mother feels dizzy and has difficulty moving her left leg if her sugar gets low. She feels better if she is given orange juice or something to eat. She has had similar symptoms to that with low sugars in the past however when the daughter checks her sugars they are all in the 174 to 225 range. She has occasional sugars before bedtime that are 337 and 249. The lowest sugar she had was 88 before dinner. 



The patient reports that she feels dizzy at times. She is a very difficult historian even with her daughter translating or with the other interpreters translating. She has not been having any chest pain or palpitations. Her dizziness is not related to standing up or lying down. No syncope, slurred speech, spinning dizziness, diplopia, or focal arm or leg weakness or numbness. 



Of note the chest pain she had complained about on the last visit when her daughter had noted she was cleaning has resolved. 



Her cardiac stress test from June 2094 showed an exercise capacity of 4 METS, EKG nondiagnostic due to submaximal heart rate response. No evidence for ischemia on the perfusion images. From March 2095 her vascular lab studies showed normal distal vertebral arteries and basilar arteries throughout its length. She also had carotid studies March 2095 that showed minimal disease of the right and left carotid. Her prior MRI from 07/95 showed chronic lacunar infarcts but no acute hemorrhage or infarct. 



The patient has had chronic slow speech and there is question about whether or not she has dementia. Her daughter is giving her the Aricept though it is not clear if this is benefiting her or not. Sometimes her daughter thinks that she is actually just being stubborn or uncooperative rather than having difficulties with her memory though other times it seems as if she she does have some dementia. 



She also has been followed in Glancy Memorial Hospital. 



On exam she is in no acute distress. Blood pressure 124/60. Neck: Supple without JVD or bruits. Lungs: Clear without wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs. Abdomen: Soft, nontender. No CCE. She has chronic right facial weakness consistent with her known Bell's palsy. Cranial nerves 2 through 12 otherwise intact though vision was not assessed. Motor 5/5. Reflexes 1+, absent ankle jerks, downgoing toes. Gait is slightly wide based which is consistent with the prior note from Dr. Hope Kincaid. Sensation intact to light touch. Distal pulses intact. 



1. Hypertension which is much better controlled on current regimen. Continue same. Check Chem-7. 



Type 2 diabetes. Her daughter attributes some of her lightheadedness to hypoglycemia but the documented sugars are not at all low. Ideally we would correlate her symptoms with a fingerstick sugar. 



Lightheadedness and dizziness. We are going to check a Chem-7 and then repeat an MRI/MRA of her head and neck. 



She should follow up in neurology and also with her counselor. She will follow up with me in a few weeks after the MRI/MRA.

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 58-year-old 
non-English-speaking Hispanic woman who presents for evaluation of 
waxing and waning epigastric/right upper quadrant abdominal pain 
for the past five days.  The patient was in her usual state of 
health until one week ago, when she developed an upper respiratory 
tract infection.  She was seen by her primary care physician, who 
treated her with Biaxin.  The patient took the Biaxin; however, she 
developed some epigastric abdominal pain on Tuesday.  She called 
her primary care physician, who attributed her abdominal pain to a 
Biaxin reaction.  She was told to discontinue the Biaxin on Thursday. 
The patient denies any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
or constipation.  She denies any dysuria, polyuria, or hematuria. 
She denies any vaginal discharge.  She denies any shortness of 
breath or chest pain.  She denies any arm, jaw, or back pain.  She 
denies any diaphoresis or dizziness.  She does admit to some 
burping and indigestion. 
She describes the pain as cramping in nature.  It waxes and wanes. 
It does not radiate anywhere.  Nothing seems to improve or worsen 
the pain. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per HPI, and otherwise negative.  In 
particular, on cardiovascular review, she denies chest pain, arm 
pain, jaw pain, or back pain; she denies any diaphoresis, 
dizziness, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea on exertion, or palpitations. 
On pulmonary, she admits to cough, but denies hemoptysis.  The 
abdominal review is as per the HPI; she denies melena.  The GU 
review is as per HPI. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (1) Type I diabetes mellitus; (2) 
Hypertension; (3) Hypothyroidism; (4) Asthma; (5) Current upper 
respiratory tract infection. 
MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol inhaler; glucophage; insulin; codeine. 
SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative tobacco.  The family 
history is negative for diabetes mellitus. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the vital signs 
reveal a temperature of 98.6 degrees F., a blood pressure of 
146/74, a pulse of 88, and a respiratory rate of 20.  The O2 
saturation is 96% on room air.  In general, the patient is in no 
acute distress.  The HEENT examination reveals the head to be 
normocephalic; the examination is atraumatic.  EOMI.  PERLA.  The 
throat is clear.  The neck is supple, with no JVD or bruits.  The 
chest shows no crepitus or retractions.  The lungs have coarse 
breath sounds.  The heart has a regular rhythm and rate without 
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen is soft, with some very 
mild epigastric tenderness, but no guarding, rebound, referred 
pain, flank tenderness, palpable masses, or pulsatile masses.  The 
extremities are warm and well-perfused without cyanosis, clubbing, 
or edema.  On neurologic, there are no focal findings. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The chest x-ray shows no acute pathology. 
The EKG shows a normal sinus rhythm at 90. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The working diagnosis was peptic 
ulcer disease exacerbation versus gastritis versus non-specific 
abdominal pain.  The patient was status post cholecystectomy five 
years ago.  She was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.  She did 
not exhibit any stigmata of an acute coronary syndrome; however, 
given her history of diabetes mellitus and her age, an EKG was 
obtained and revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 90, without any 
ischemic or infarctive changes.  She was medicated with 30 cc of 
Maalox and 150 mg of Axid, which seemed to improve her pain 
considerably.  Serial abdominal examinations did not reveal any 
peritoneal signs or worsening abdominal pain.  The patient did not 
have any medical records on the computer at this time.  Nursing and 
Triage notes were reviewed and I concur in those findings. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Abdominal pain, suspect gastritis versus peptic 
ulcer disease. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 
given abdominal pain instructions in Spanish.  She was given a 
prescription for Axid and for Maalox.  She was to follow up with 
her primary care physician the next day and return if symptoms were 
to recur or worsen.  She was discharged in improved and stable 
condition.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pressure.

Mr. Ogrady is seen by the resident and also seen and examined by

me.  He is a transfer from an outside hospital to be admitted

because of his chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old man who was

loading some luggage in a car this morning at about 4:30 a.m.  At

that time, he experienced acute onset of squeezing, chest pain,

and chest pressure associated with shortness of breath.  He

described his pain as being very intense about 9/10, described

heaviness across his chest and shortness of breath.  He stated

that while he was walking into his place his chest pain got worse

and since then it was intermittent and stuttering in nature.  He

was taken to Muncy Valley Hospital where he was seen, treated,

and transferred here.  He is currently pain free.  At Oakridge State his troponin was negative.  His CPK was

negative.  His EKG showed a Q-wave in III and aVF and had no

acute ST elevation or ST depression on his cardiogram which

correlates with our cardiogram here.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His history, however, is significant in

that he has a cardiac catheterization that was done in 06/2093. 

At that time, he had proximal LAD lesion of 30%, left main was

30%, and left circumflex was also 30%.  He had an RCA lesion

which was 100%, RCA proximal lesion, with good collateral flow. 

His last echocardiogram was in 03/2093.  At that time, his LV

function was normal and he had an EF of 55% to 60%.  His past

medical history is significant for diabetes and hypertension as

well as high cholesterol, had an myocardial infarction in 2084,

history of metastatic esophageal cancer and history of DVT in his

left lower extremity in 2090.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He has had an esophagectomy.  He

underwent fem-pop bypass surgery in 2088.  He has also had a

cholecystectomy and appendectomy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a 40-pack-year smoker.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Also, has a strong family history of cardiac

disease.

MEDICATIONS:  He is now pain free but described his pain this

morning as squeezing, pressure like, and heaviness in his chest.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His vital signs here are normal.  His

HEENT exam is benign.  His neck is supple with clear lungs

bilaterally.  He has a 3/6 systolic murmur.  He has no rubs or

gallops.  His pulses are normal, well perfused throughout and

warm extremities.  Abdomen is soft without any masses, good bowel

sounds.  Extremities are normal.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG as described above again, a Q in III and

aVF, otherwise no acute changes on his cardiogram.  His CK is 33

and his troponin is negative.  His creatinine is 1.9 with a BUN

of 27.  All other labs are normal including his blood sugar which

is 156.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient's cardiologist is Dr.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

rule out and maybe even need another cardiac catheterization if

necessary.

DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain and chest pressure with history of an MI

and history of coronary artery disease.

History of Present Illness

Mr. Quin presented in 2061 with a PSA of around 4 and a prostate cancer of unknown clinical grade. Radical retropubic prostatectomy was performed in the BNH system, and disease extended beyond the prostate to the margins of the resection and into the seminal vesicle. In early 2062 he received adjuvant radiation. His PSA remained undetectable throughout the 2060s, but was troubled by a great deal of radiation cystitis with hematuria, frequency, and dysuria. In addition, he was totally incontinent. In 2071 his PSA was undetectably low.   

Over the last 8 months, he has developed low back pain of progressively increasing severity. His PSA back in September 2075 was approximately 3 and when checked in November was 17. Early this year his pain was of great severity, and repeat CT scans and bone scans were performed. Destructive disease was seen in the body of L4 with foraminal encroachment. The thecal sac and the cauda quina were, however, intact. He was started in early February on bicalutamide and was scheduled to have a Zoladex injection, but his pain became more and more severe, and ultimately he was admitted to the LMH last week where I first met him. Since admission he was started on urgent radiotherapy and has completed 12 cycles of radation with a last PSA of 1.7.  He is due for Lupron injection on 6/13/76 at which time a PSA will be checked.

His oncologist Dr. Leblanc has helped him wean the MS Contin and tried to start adding low dose gabapentin as a narcotic sparing agent for presumed neuropathic pain.  He is not requiring his prn pain meds very often.

He has claudication.

He has symmetric leg edema worse right after lupron injection and improved with TEDS.  No chest symptoms.





Problems

      Prostate cancer

Plan as above

      Claudication    : has buttock pain when walking which resolves when stopping.  He has decreased pulses in his DPs bilaterally and has a h/o smoking and diabetes.

      Diabetes mellitus type 2

checks his sugars infrequently.  He is on glyburide 10 am 5 pm.  He had his eyes checked by an opthalmologist recently and no evidence of retinopathy was present. He has no early satiety, blurry vision, polyuria polydipsia, foot ulcers, chest pain, shorteness of breath, but does have some claudication.  He is not on an ACE- inhibitor, takes HCTZ for BP control and has had hematuria from aspirin.

Medications

Glycuride 10am 5 pm

Colace TID

MSCOntin 30 mg am 30 pm with Morphine 15 mg q4h for breakthough but not needing it.

Prilosec 40

Gabapentin Just restarted 100 mg po tid





Disposition and Plans

1. Pain- I think he has a component of neuropathic pain.  I think that we will start low dose neuronitni 100 tid for 7 days, he will email me about how his pain is and we will cut his pm MScontin in half if we can.  I do not want to have to use exteremely high doses of gabapentin to spare narcotics because he is not a drug seeker and I want him to be comfortable and he has no congnitive problems with safe adminstration or dosing.  His PSA is low and will continue to follow.  If his pain is at night which sometimes it is, he could have a component of restless legs from arterial insufficiency, will check PVRs anyway to rule that out

2. Cluadication- check PVRs, most likely has bilateral iliofemoral disease. He does not want to take aspirin given hiematuria in the past. I will broach this issue next time again

3. DM- will email me his sugars and will adjust oral agents as necessary,. He needs U/a for microalb, eas encourgagd to wear shoes in house, will check PVrs, will start low dose lisinopril for BP and prevention of diabetic nephropathy and heck creatinine and K one week after starting the medicaiton.  Will check lipids.  Will continue to monitor BP.  Will start aspirin when he is willing.

 

Plan to follow up with patient by email

will see in clinic RTC in 3 months

2) Paresthesias in feet- assume due to DM- already on Neurontin (and tegretol for psych issues).  Suggest consult by pharmacology.  Would like to broaden her pain control regimen to other modalities (non - narcotics, hydrotherapy, etc).



3)  DM- says FS at home have been <180 now on NPH bid.



4)  Psychosocial- benefits from limit setting and clear boundaries, ressurance. Anxiolytics and antidepressants. depression meds from outside mental health provider.



I expect her stay to be brief.  Dr. Bruce Koontz will cover the weekend 12/09/96 through 12/10/96.

Re:  KLEIN, Michelle
   MRN: 2474410
   DOB: 8/6/2075

Dear Dr. Keller,

Ms. Klein was seen in general neurology clinic today following her recent admission for complex migraine.   Dr. Remigio Allison was present for or performed all salient aspects of the history and physical exam and together we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan. We spent greater than 50% of the visit in education and counseling of the patient and family.

HPI: As you know, Ms. Klein is a 74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD stent (2144), migraine, who was in her USOH until the afternoon of 2/6/50 when she experienced sudden onset of garbled speech and difficulty ""expressing myself"" while cooking lunch for she and her husband.  This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull, L fronto-temporal headache that persisted for several hours.  She states she did not have word-finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself.   In particular she related several examples of semantic paraphasic errors.  The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1-2 hours before she resolved back to baseline.  In addition to headache, associated symptoms included generalized weakness, feeling cold and mildly nauseated.  She denied visual changes, chest pain, sob, palpitations, lightheadedness, vertigo, difficulty with swallowing, coordination or gait.  She describes having a glass of orange juice with the thought that her sugar might be low, without apparent effect.  She recalled one similar episode ~ 2 years ago at which time she had her husband drive her home and she went to bed.  The speech difficulty had resolved by morning, and she apparently never told her physician or had any further work-up.  She has no known history of seizures but migraines occur 1-2x/year, last 30 minutes to several hours and are typically preceeded by scintillating scotoma (   jagged horizontal lines   ), associated with nausea/photophobia, and relieved by sleep.

Given her multiple vascular risk factors, she was admitted for TIA work-up which was unremarkable with the exception of mildly elevated HbA1c (7.0) including lipids, ESR, homocysteine, lipoprotein (a), TTE and holter.  CT/CT-a and MRI did not show any evidence of acute stroke or significant cervical or intracranial arterial stenosis.  She was discharged on her home medications, which included ASA 325mg po qd, with a diagnosis of complex migraine.  Since return home, she has had additional typical episodes of migraine, (about every 2 weeks) without the aphasia which brought her into the hospital.  She has tried Excedrin migraine a few times recently, with good results.

ROS:  Sometimes    sees stars    when she stands up too quickly after bending over.  Similarly feels that her balance is transiently affected when getting out of bed in the morning (   I rock   ).  She is awaiting thyroid biopsy of the nodules incidentally discovered on CT-CT-a.  Negative in detail including change in weight, energy, appetite, CP, palpitations, SOB, DOE, N/V/D/cough, fever, chills, rash, BRBPR, melena, abdominal pain, change in bowel or bladder habits.  In addition, patient denies change in vision, hearing, tinnitus, vertigo, numbness, weakness, slurred speech, difficulty with language, swallowing, eating, or gait.

Impression and Recommendations:  74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD stent (2144), migraine s/p recent episode of transient aphasia and headache thought most likely to represent complex migraine given clinical presentation and after largely unremarkable stroke/TIA work-up.  Since discharge, she has continued to have her baseline migraines at a frequency of ~ 2x/month.  At this point, we would not recommend beginning prophylactic therapy, but would consider doing so if attacks become more frequent.  Given her clinical response to Excedrin migraine, we have suggested continuing this drug for abortive therapy, but have spoken at length about the phenomenon of rebound headache and cautioned her about using it more than once every 10-14 days.  We have discussed the phenomenon of complex migraine and reinforced the inherent difficulties of distinguishing these attacks from TIA/stroke; thus we have urged to continue to take unusual non-stereotyped deficits seriously.  She will follow-up with us in 4-6 months or sooner if the need arises. 

Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.  We look forward to seeing her in follow-up.

Sincerely,

Educare-Fargo A MSIII Admission Note

Pt: Lindsay, Anastasha	

MR#: 	 5563788

Date of Admission: 10/07/15

Attending: 	



Source: Pt, Pt's daughter and husband, chart.



CC:  Dizziness, unsteady gait, difficulty speaking per family



HPI:  74 yo F with pmh of DM, CRI, Breast Ca, CVA, who is s/p cataract surgery on 09/25/15 presents with two days of unsteady gait, weakness, mild dysarthria and hallucinations.



She has a baseline amount of increasing forgetfulness, decreased appetite, and increased somnolence over the past 2 years.  She frequently forgets whether or not she has taken her medications.  She rarely leaves her home as her walking is limited by joint pain and shortness of breath.  She moves around the house infrequently and when she does it is usually from the bed to the couch per her daughter.  She has had several falls in the recent years.  She does not cook and is overall much less active than her husband who lives with her.  At her baseline, her family is concerned that she has been developing Alzheimer's Disease.  



Twelve days ago, she underwent cataract surgery on her R eye and was in her usual state of health for several days thereafter.  However, two days ago, she started to hallucinate mentioning she was seeing flies, birds and spots.  Her family noted that she had difficulty forming words and also spoke incoherently at times.  She also complained of dizziness, had an increasingly unsteady gait, and did not want to eat both expressing no interest in food and saying she was worried about not being able to swallow.  She has also been falling asleep very rapidly recently, so much so that she has fallen asleep on her plate at the breakfast table.  However, she has also woken up frequently at night, often talking incoherently and once even getting up and attempting to cook breakfast at 3am.  Her family also mentions that her face had recently become swollen. Her family reports that her symptoms were worsened after she took her Diamox, and thus they stopped giving it to her.  



She was brought to the ED on 10/06/15 as her family was concerned that she had another CVA.  Her VS on admission were BP 120/41, HR 54, RR 18, T 96.4, O2 sat 96% on RA.  She had a negative CT, MRI, CXR and labs were drawn.  In the ED she reportedly had an episode of choking while eating a pancake. Currently, she reports that she is seeing many small black dots, is tired and has no dizziness, HA or pain.



ROS:  Notable on ROS is progressive dysphagia over the last year that she reports has gotten much worse of late.  She also reports occasional transient stabbing pain in the center of her sternum that often accompanies intense emotions and is not made worse by activity.   She has occasional palpitations.

She reports no recent fever, wt loss, cough, hemoptosis, orthopnea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, sick contacts.  She reports some urinary incontinence.



PMH: 

Breast Ca- Diagnosed in 10/2111, she is s/p R lumpectomy and XRT for her tumor that was HER-2/neu 2+.  She is followed by Dr. Ursula Marshall at SDP.  

DM- Controlled by insulin.  Her most recent HbA1c was 6.0 in June 2115.

CVA- 3 yrs ago, had abrupt onset of L hemiparesis that resoloved within 48 hrs. Has PFO.

CRI- Thought to be due to DM.

Rest ECG:

 The baseline cardiac rhythm was normal sinus rhythm. The rest electrocardiogram revealed poor R-wave progression and  nonspecific ST segment and T-wave abnormalities.

Stress ECG:

    No ST segment changes were observed during this test.  Arrhythmias: None.

2. Echo: 3/29/12:  Nl dimensions.  EF 58%.  Mild mitral regurg.  Mild tricuspid insuff.  Patent foramen ovale.



A/P:  74 yo F with pmh of DM, CRI, Breast Ca, CVA, who is s/p cataract surgery on 09/25/15 presents with two days of unsteady gait, weakness, mild dysarthria and hallucinations.  She has dementia at baseline and has recently had the addition of Diamox, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, to her medications.  This could have had the effect of decreasing her intravascular volume, thus leading to a prerenal state and her increased uremia, and decreased renal clearance of her renally cleared medications, thus leading to acute delirium on chronic dementia.  



Common causes of delirium include FEN disturbances, infections, drug toxicity, metabolic disorders, low perfusion states, withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives, and idiopathic.  In addition, there is the possibility of CVA, however the MRI and CT were negative and the time course and symptoms are not consistent with a CVA.  Of concern though is that she has somewhat atypical signs of delirium such as dysarthria and ataxia.



Metabolic causes of delirium commonly include Na, Ca, Mg, B12, NH3 imbalances.  Her Na, Mg and Ca are wnl.  Her BUN is elevated at 77, which is close to twice her baseline, and in the setting of a fragile patient, this could be enough to tip her over to delirium.  Her glucose was 215 on admission, which is elevated, but only mildly so for a diabetic and not at high enough levels for MS changes to occur.



Infection is possible as her WBC is slightly elevated at 12.1 with 78% poly's.  However, there is no obvious source of infection and she has a normal CXR and U/A, likely ruling out a PNA and UTI respectively.  She has no signs of infection at the site of her eye surgery.  She could have a bacteremia secondary to other infection or due to her procedure, but without a fever, this is highly unlikely.



Her mental status change could be drug induced, as she is on multiple medications with the recent addition of Prednisolone and Vigamox eye drops as well as Diamox that was recently stopped by the family.  Eye drops generally do not get particularly high systemic absorption, although there is an anatomic proximity to the CNS.  However, cardiovascular drugs, antidepressants, and corticosteroids are all known to induce delirium and she is on all of them, including two SSRI's.  The new Diamox could be enough to tip her over as it is a diuretic and by itself it can cause confusion, and by inducing more diuresis, it can cause a prerenal state, thus decreasing renal clearance of her other drugs and increasing their levels, thus leading to delirium.   Indeed, her baseline Creatinine is from 1.6-1.9 and was 2.4 on admission to the ED and her baseline BUN is from 20-40 while it was 82 on admission to the ED.



There is no present concern for drug toxicity and her tox screen was negative.  There was no seizure activity noted and her symptoms have gone on too long to be a post-ictal state



Her BP on admission was 115/51 and her pulse was 62, which does not point to a low perfusion state as a cause.  She had a recent stress test that was negative.  However, it is possible that she has some orthostasis, which would fit with her recent history of falls at home.  However, this would not cause the delirium.



Her dementia has been developing over a few years and the possible etiologies include Alzheimer's, vascular dementia, pseudodementia, thyroid abnormalities, B12 and/or Folate deficiency, tertiary syphilis and chronic infarct dementia.  Chronic infarct dementia is a distinct possibility with MRI of brain showing chronic infarcts in the right posterior frontal and left parietal regions.  Her stasis, DM and high homocysteine levels (18.8 in 2113) are risk factors with PFO for multi-infarct dementia.



Plan:

1. Delirium:  

500 cc bolus of NS, followed by maintenance IVF of 1/2NS at 80cc/hr.

TSH, B12, Folate, RPR, ESR.

D/C her HCTZ, Avapro, Atenolol and recheck her lytes in the AM.  

Call PROMPTCARE in AM for consult re the d/c of Diamox.

Seroquel 12.5 mg overnight.



2. Renal failure:

	likely pre-renal given FeNa<2% and response to fluids in ED

	continue gentle hydration

	D/C HCTZ, Diamox as likely precipitants of delerium and renal failure



3. ID: 	 Cont to monitor for signs/sx of infection.  None currently present.



4. GI:	Elevated Pancreatic Enzymes: 

No signs or symptoms currently.  Cont to follow.

Elevated AST and AlkPhos: Consider ordering a GGT.

Dysphagia: consider a barium swallow.

 

5. FEN: 	Speech and Swallow consult.  Soft diet.



6. Proph: Nexium, Heparin.  PT/OT

Intern addendum:

Pt seen and examined with Gary Aragon, agree with assessment and plan. In brief, 74F with dementia presenting with acute on chronic renal failure and delerium. Etiology likely multifactorial, however, diamox is the only new medication and may explain both her worsening renal failure and delirium. Will pursue broad differential as outlined above.

Re:  Dalila Haynes
       783-61-34-3


Dear Dr. Kay: 


I saw Dalila Haynes today in consultation concerning the possibility of neurosarcoidosis.  She comes with her daughter who assists with the history.  I will review her history for the record.


She is a 69-year-old right-handed woman who was hospitalized at the Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss.  Her daughter notes that she had deteriorated over the course of a month or two.  Her movements slowed down, and she became unsteady on her feet, and her memory deteriorated.  This culminated in a fall in July prompting her hospitalization.  During that hospitalization a head CT on 7/25/03 was reported unremarkable.  (There is mild ventriculomegaly on it.)  An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus. There was no abnormal enhancement.  This was consistent with small vessel stroke.  EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features.  An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC.  CSF ACE was normal.  Cultures were negative.  CSF VDRL was negative.  Because she has a history of sarcoidosis, it was thought that this likely represented neurosarcoidosis.  She was started on prednisone 40 mg daily.  Her daughter has noted some improvement in her movements and cognition since starting the prednisone, but she remains abnormal.  She has lowered the prednisone to 10 mg daily now.  Reviewing the laboratory studies today, I see that although an RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab.  She and her daughter are aware of no prior history of syphilis.  Other studies during her hospitalization included low serum Na (133) and Mg (1.3), normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20).  CSF HSV PCR was negative.  HbA1C was elevated at 8.6.  


She has a history of asthma going back many years.  According to her daughter, she had a skin lesion excised from near her left eye about two years ago.  Apparently, this showed noncaseated granuloma, and that is when the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was first made.  She then had a mediatinoscopy on 4/10/02.  Biopsy of mediastinal nodes showed granulomatous inflammation without caseating necrosis, supporting the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.  She has type II DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, GERD, and she has had a thyroid adenoma.  


Her current medications are prednisone 10 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, troglitazone, metformin, glyburide, sisinoril, pravastatin, vitamin D, calcium CO3, Colace, and an inhaler for her asthma as needed.  She is allergic to sulfa agents and to fluticasone nasal spray.  There is no history of allergy to PCN.  


Her parents both died of some type of cancer.  There is no family history of sarcoidosis or of neurologic disease.


She is a widow.  She has four children.  She used to work for Lowe's.  She now lives with a daughter. 


She has had no recent fever or chills.  Her weight has been stable and her appetite good.  There is no history of exertional chest pain or palpitations.  There is no history of cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  She has had no rash or joint symptoms.


Pulse 126, regular.  BP 126/66.  She is obese.  Ears, nose, and throat are clear.  There are no cranial bruits.  The neck is supple with full carotid pulses and no bruits.  There are wheezes bilaterally.  The heart is regular with no murmur.  The abdomen is benign.  The extremities are normal.


There is general psychomotor slowing.  She is oriented to time, expect that she gets the date off by two days as Aug 31.  She is oriented to place.  She is inattentive.  She is able to recite the months in order, but she gets lost trying to recite them in reverse.  She has trouble registering 4 words, and she recalls only 2 of 4 after three minutes.  There is no aphasia.  She cannot copy interlocking pentagons and her copy of a 3D cube shows poor spacial representation.  


The visual fields are full.  The pupils are 3 mm and normally reactive.  The fundi are poorly visualized.  .  The eye movements are full and conjugate with no nystagmus; pursuit movement are saccadic.  Facial sensation is intact.  Facial power is normal and symmetric.  Hearing is grossly intact.  Weber and Rinne tests are normal.  The palate elevates normal.  Gag is present.  The sternocleidomastoid and trapezius power are normal.  The tongue protrudes in the midline.  Muscle bulk, tone, and power are normal.  There is a low-amplitude, high-frequency tremor in action and rest.  Temperature and pinprick sensation are diminished in the lower extremities with a distally-predominant gradient.  Reflexes are normal (2/4) and symmetric in the upper extremities and at the knees and absent at the ankles.  Plantar responses are flexor.  Coordination is intact.  Romberg is negative.  Gait and station are normal.


Her treponemal test for syphilis came back positive from the hospitalization in July.  Since syphilis, too, could cause noncaseating granulomas, and she has clearly has syphilis at some point in the past which was probably untreated, this raises some doubt about the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.  I will review that issue with you and with Dr, Villalpando.  She had CSF pleocytosis in July.  With that and the positive treponemal test (FTA), she will need a full course of intravenous penicillin for presumed neurosyphilis.  I will discuss arrangements for possible outpatient management of hatt with a PICC line and outpatient VNA services.  Concerning her need for prednisone, I think that will depend on our interpretation of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in light of this new diagnosis.  If the evidence of sarcoidosis is not strong with this alternative diagnosis, then we can plan to complete the course of penicillin and taper and discontinue the prednisone and then follow her clinical course, her CSF, and her syphilis serologies.


Finally, from the MRI of 7/28, shows a couple of tiny foci of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.  These are most consistent with small vessel ischemic strokes.  She has multiple risk factors for common small vessel disease and stroke, but in the context of her inflammatory CSF and evidence of prior syphilis, we must also consider cerebrovascular syphilis as the likely cause of this.


I would recommend treatment now with a 14-day course of high-dose (20-24 million units a day) penicillin.  She is already on prednisone which might help to prevent any possible Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.  I think that if she remains stable after the initiation of her PCN therapy, then we can plan to taper and then discontinue the prednisone, to follow her clinically and with repeated LP, and determine any need for future corticosteroid therapy on her course.  


Thank you for this consultation.




Sincerely,






Keondre Viera, M.D.

routine follow-up. 
Past medical history is notable for no ankle injuries previously. 
He has a history of diabetes and sleep apnea.  He takes Prozac,
Cardizem, Glucophage and Amaryl.  He is also followed by Dr. Harold
Nutter for an arrhythmia.  He does not smoke.  He drinks
minimally.  He is a set designer at Columbia Pictures.
 
On examination today he has slight tenderness of the left ankle
about four fingerbreadths above the malleolus.  The malleolus is
non-tender medially or laterally with no ligamentous tenderness
either.  Dorsal flexion and plantar flexion is without pain. 
There is no significant swelling.  There are no some skin changes
with some small abrasions proximally.  There is no fibular
tenderness proximally.  No anterior pain is noted.  No hindfoot,
midfoot or forefoot tenderness is noted. 
I would like him to use a tube sock with his air cast.  He is
using a cane for ambulation.  His x-rays do not show a notable
fracture pattern today, and we will await the Radiology opinion. 
I would like him to stay in the air splint with the sock.  I will
see him back in six weeks for review at the Boxborough office. 
 
 
Diagnosis:  Left ankle fracture.

RE:  Otis Narvaez
     MR #045-61-32-6

Dear Uddin:

Otis Narvaez is a 67 year old man who returned to the office today for follow-up after having
undergone an Adenosine PET scan on March 04, 2077.  His previous visit with me occurred on
February 19, 2077, where his acute complaint was shortness of breath with any activity.  He
denied chest pain, but did admit to a ""tight"" feeling down his left arm on occasion.  This was not
associated with activity.  He admits to being a very sedentary person.  

The results of his Adenosine MIBI were abnormal, with abnormal myocardial perfusion, global
LV function, and CT coronary angiography.  There were no significant findings on the clinical
evaluation.  The response was non-ischemic, and there were no EKG changes during infusion. 
The results revealed a small calcified plaque in the proximal LAD coronary artery without flow-
limiting stenosis.  There was a more heavily calcified plaque visualized in the distal RCA which
was flow-limiting, and there was a moderate amount of stress-induced ischemia on imaging. 
There was severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 32%.  The
narrowing in the distal segment of the RCA was greater than 70%.  

A lipid profile performed following his office visit on February 19, 2077 revealed a total
cholesterol of 182 mg/dl, an HDL of 43 mg/dl, an LDL of 71 mg/dl, and a triglyceride level of
342 mg/dl.  He has not been on any cholesterol-lowering medications.  

He had undergone previous cardiac catheterization in November 2072, which demonstrated
insignificant coronary artery disease, with an ejection fraction of 63%.

Since his last office visit, he continues to be significantly short of breath with any activity.  He
denies any chest pain or left arm discomfort.  

His current medications include Ritalin 20 mg five times daily, Ambien 10 mg at hour of sleep,
Neurontin 900 mg three times daily, Lasix 20 mg every other day, Lisinopril 60 mg once daily,

aspirin 325 mg with Oxycodone as needed.  He usually takes these once every other day.  He is
now on 20 units of an insulin preparation that he cannot identify.  He takes this at bedtime.

Review of systems reveals that he has chronic peripheral neuropathy in his feet.  This causes him
to feel imbalanced, and it is necessary for him to walk with a cane.

He was diagnosed with diabetes in 2068 and hypertension in 2067.  He also has chronic low
back pain due to degenerative joint disease, as well as lumbar disc disease.  He also has
degenerative joint disease in his knees.  He receives psychiatric follow-up for his diagnosis of
depression.  

He underwent a gastric bypass procedure at Harmon Medical Rehabilitation Hospital in 2068.

On January 20, 2073, he underwent a left lingular-sparing upper lobectomy for a T1 squamous
cell carcinoma.  

On physical examination, he appears healthy, albeit overweight, with a normal affect.  His
weight is 208 lbs, the heart rate is 84 beats per minute, the respiratory rate is 16 per minute, and
the blood pressure is 140/62 mm/Hg.  Examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
reveals upper dentures in place.  There is no jugular vein distention, and the lungs are clear. 
There is increased AP diameter with bilateral gynecomastia.  On cardiac examination, the heart
sounds are distant, and there is a regular rhythm, a normal S1, a single S2, and no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  The lower extremity examination reveals a 2 cm tender superficial area on the
distal right calf.  There is no edema noted.

I discussed with Otis Narvaez and his wife, Santiago, my recommendations for a cardiac
catheterization followed by stent placement, as indicated.  He has agreed to this, and Dr. Yaziel
Kraft will perform the procedure.  His office will call Mr. Narvaez to schedule the
catheterization.  After leaving the office today, he will have a CBC, a PT, a PTT, and a
comprehensive metabolic profile performed.  He will return to see me in the office again in one
month.

Best personal regards.

Sincerely,


Kenneth Z. Sellers, M.D.

INTERN/MED STUDENT ADMIT NOTE, Team 3





Name:  Mr. Danny Nielson

MR #:  9156593

Date of admission: 08/28/2097

Admitting Physician: Dr. Gene Quadri, MD	

PCP: Dr. Ulises Noel

Source of Hx:  Patient, Available note

Code: Full

          

CC:     Want to get my chemo   



ID: Mr. Nielson is a 77 yoM w/ Stage IIIB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s/p 4 cycles of CHOP and 1 cycle of R-ICE who presents now for cycle 2 of R-ICE.  



HPI:   Mr. Nielson was in his usual state of health until March of this year when he began noticing increasing swelling in his left leg over a period of three weeks.  He also developed b/l groin swelling greater on the left; the swelling in the left groin was tender.  He presented in early April where CT and PET scan of the pelvis and abdomen revealed a 6.0 cm inguinal node, a chain of nodes in the retrocrural space, adenopathy in the external iliac chain (largest 3.5 cm), and two nodes in the retroperitoneal space in between the IVC and aorta.  He underwent biopsy of the left groin mass two weeks later revealing DLBCL confimed by immunophenotyping.  Subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed polyclonal B-cell populations and an inverted CD4/CD8 T Cell ratio, with no evidence of monoclonal proliferation.  The patient underwent his initial two cycles of CHOP in May, and experienced no adverse effects except for generalized weakness.  PET exam in early June revealed larger left groin mass, improvement in lymphadenopathy, and a small pancreatic cystic lesion.  It was undetermined whether this represented treatment effect or worsening of disease.  



The patient subsequently had his next two CHOP treatments in mid June and early July.  PET scan and lymph node biopsy in early July revealed unchanged disease with evidence of fibrosis and inflammation.  The patient was seen in clinic by Dr. Quadri twice in July, with the second visit revealing increased PET avidity and persistence of the primary mass.  Given the persistence of the mass and lack of response to CHOP, the patient was evaluated by Dr. Rodgers of the WDMC one week later on 7/28 for consideration of auto-SCT vs more aggressive chemo regimen.  Due to the patient's age and consideration of risk/benefit, it was decided that the best approach would be to attempt a more aggressive chemo regimen first.  Mr. Nielson was admitted on 8/2/2097 to receive his first cycle of R-ICE with dose-reduced Ifos and carboplatin becuase of h/o nephrectomy.  He tolerated the treatment fairly well with some panycytopenia.  Patient felt the R-ICE regimen was a little    harder    on him than the CHOP regimen.  He felt effects including fatigue and constipation that resolved back to baseline in a few days.  On 8/9, he was given 2 units of packed red cells due to anemia and on 8/16, he was given a unit of pheresis platelets for his thrombocytopenia as well as two units of packed red blood cells for his anemia.  He was initially scheduled to receive cycle 2 of R-ICE on 8/22 but that was delayed due to his thrombocytopenia.  He says that he currently feels cold-intolerance and fatigue that is the same as when he first started his chemotherapy in May.  He denies any recent N/V, diarrhea, constipation, lightheadedness, orthostatic dizziness, hematuria, BRBPR, or melena.  Side effects of note from previous cycles of chemotherapy include generalized weakness, cold-intolerance, and constipation.

Team III Intern Addendum



I have seen and examined the pt and I agree with excellent Internal Medicine note above.



In brief, this is a 77 yo man w/ Stage IIIB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s/p 4 cycles of CHOP and 1 cycle of R-ICE her now for his cycle 2 of R-ICE.  We will maintain hydration and monitor renal function as this pt has only one kidney. His type two diabetes will be controlled with his home regimen and his maintenance steroids that he takes for Wegener's will be held as they are replaced by dexamethasone via R-ICE. We will transfuse to maintain platelets over 20K and HCT over 25 as needed. His exam is non-concerning.

RE:  Bruce Corona

FHC Unit #:  795-76-17



Dear Dunham:



I had the pleasure of seeing  Bruce Corona in the Cardiology Department office for a f/u visit.  Since I last saw him, he continues to complain of dyspnea.  An ETT was negative for ischemia.  PFTs were not really useful.  CT of the chest showed scarring/fibrosis.  His NT-proBNP has been on the marginal side, though he is without evidence for overt CHF.



Medications:  Aspirin 325 mg qd, Flomax 0.4 mg qd, Lopressor 25 mg bid, Lipitor 10 mg qd, Lisinopril 20 mg qd, Colace 100 mg tid.



Physical examination:  Reveals him to be well appearing. His BP is 120/70 and his heart rate is 60 and regular. He is 170 pounds.  There is no jugular venous distention and carotid pulses are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.  His lungs are clear throughout, and notably demonstrate only very slight dullness at the left base.  His sternotomy is healing well and is stable.  His apical impulse is non-displaced with a slightly irregular rate and rhythm, a normal S1 and S2.  He has an S3 gallop.  No murmur.  His abdomen is benign without hepatosplenomegaly, bruits, or a dilated aorta.  There is no pedal edema and posterior tibial pulses are 2+ bilaterally.



EKG:  NSR with a 1st degree AV block.  He has a LBBB, which is chronic.



Impression:



1.CAD, s/p MI: currently stable.



2. Hypertension: under good control.



3.Hypercholesterolemia: controlled



4. Dyspnea: I suspect he has an element of diastolic dysfunction.  I will restart low-dose lasix.



Thank you very much for the opportunity to participate in his care.



With best regards,



Bruce D. Brian, Jr., M.D.

NAME:     Usrey, John 

MRN:       6762675



This is a 76-year-old man who comes in with a chief complaint of left calf pain. 

This occurs after walking about one block and pain is sufficient to prevent him

from walking further.  He will then stop, pain will disappear.  He will continue

walking at which time it will occur at about the same distance.  There is no rest

pain.  The pain had been present for a couple of months although it has been

increasing in severity.   



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Is significant for intracranial bleed secondary to an

AV malformation.  He refused surgery at that time at Campellton-Graceville Hospital and has done

well on Dilantin without any seizures.  There has been no further bleed or problem

from this malformation.  He also has treated hypothyroidism.  He is status post

TURP, cholecystectomy, and appendectomy.  He does have a chronic anxiety

disorder for which he is on Ativan intermittently.  He also has pustular psoriasis.



MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin 600 mg per day, which keeps his level at about 7.  At

these levels he has had no seizures.  He is also on Synthroid at 0.075 per day.  



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a mostly German-speaking man.  There is a

right-sided tremor which has been present since his intracranial bleed.  Neck

supple.  Blood pressure is at 140/80.  Weight 184.  Heart rate is at 70.  There are

no carotid bruits.  Lungs are clear.  Heart is regular without gallop or murmur. 

Abdominal exam - No mass, tenderness, or organomegaly.  There are multiple

scars. There is a bruit over the right femoral artery with a decreased pulsation there

compared to the left.  There is no pulse palpable below popliteal on the right side. 

There is no visible ischemic change of the right leg.  The left femoral is fuller, and

there is a palpable dorsalis pedis on that side.  



IMPRESSION:  Peripheral vascular disease, probably right iliofemoral.  He will

undergo arteriovascular studies.  He will also be placed on aspirin at 81 mg per

day.  In addition he is begun on Lipitor 10 mg per day for hyperlipidemia.  He will

follow up following that vascular study.  This evaluation was also communicated to

her daughter, Quinn, because of the language barrier.

CC:   Pt is a 59 year old female with h/o SLE, interstitial nephritis, GERD, h/o positive stress s/p RCA angioplasty 2082, and chronic abdominal pain who presents with c/o two weeks of intermittent chest pain.





HPI: Pt initially presented to her PCP on day of admission with a complaint of 2 weeks of intermittent chest pain. Pt reported that pain has been lasting anywhere from 20 min to 1 hour and that it emanates from the L sternal border with radiation to L lateral thorax and radiation to L arm, accompanied by tingling/numbness in L digits + occasionally right digits, as well as down the L leg. In PVH ED, pt describes the pain as    like a bleeding scar    and states    my heart is bloated    through her daughter who acted as her interpreter.  She reports that the pain, at it's worst is 5/10, but has improved to 2/10 after NTG en route to the ED and once in the ED.  She affirms nausea and diaphoresis accompany pain. Pain has no relationship to position or activity -- has occurred during sitting, ambulation, and reclining. Pt lives on the second story of her building and has noted that walking up stairs has been been more difficult over the past two weeks secondary to calf and ankle pain, L > R, follow by chest pain.  Pt has not had to use more pillows in the past two weeks when sleeping, and reports no change in the number of times per week that she wakes up short of breath, which varies between one to two times per week.  Pt denies increased swelling in extremities over the past two weeks or increase in weight.

Radiology:

Dissection Protocol CT of 12-Dec-2091: reveals no evidence of aortic dissection. Complex cyst within the spleen. Uterine fibroids.  Degenerative disc disease.



CXR of 12-Dec-2091: The lungs are clear.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  The bones are unremarkable.





EKG:   

12-Dec-2091: Sinus brady with a rate of approximately 50.  Normal axis.  Normal intervals.  No ST elevations or depressions.  Q waves in leads II, III and AVF c/w prior inferior infarct.  Q waves in V5, V6.  Good R wave progression.  No atrial or ventricular enlargement noted.  No change from prior ECG's. 



Adenosine MIBI 6/20/2089: 

 The ECG response to pharmacological stress was  negative for

 ischemia. The myocardial perfusion scans show a small size, mild

 intensity, primarily fixed inferolateral defect consistent with

 prior infarct with substantial residual viable myocardium but only

 minimal stress induced ischemia. Compared to the study of 01/26 with

 treadmill exercise (RPP ~24K) the previously noted anterior wall

 defect is less apparent in the present exam.



CARDIAC CATH OF 12/09/2082:

Successful PTCA of the mid RCA with a 3.0 mm balloon with 20 to 30 per cent residual plaque and a hazzines consistent with possible small dissection.



Pt referred by Dr. YARBROUGH, underwent catheterization for

unstable angina, a positive exercise text and recent myocardial infarction.



PROCEDURE

PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY was performed on the Mid RCA using a maximum balloon size of 3.0 mm advanced through a 9YS7EZ guiding catheter.





Assessment:  Pt is a 59 year old female with h/o SLE, interstitial nephritis, GERD, h/o positive stress s/p RCA angioplasty 2082, and chronic abdominal pain who presents with c/o two weeks of intermittent chest pain reproducible upon palpation who is admitted to rule out MI with one set of negative cardiac enzymes and no EKG changes.



Plan:

1.	Chest Pain: Likely musculoskeletal in nature given reproducibility of pain on palpation.  However, given pt's cardiac history, will obtain two more sets of cardiac markers.  Adenosine stress test scheduled for a.m. with echocardiogram pending, as well.  Pt's Atenenlol switched to Lopressor during admission.  Pt Dilatrate-SR changed to Isordil.    Continuing home meds of Nifedipine and ASA.  Pt to be NPO after midnight for am cardiac testing.



2.	SLE: Continuing home dose of prednisone, as well as Vitamins C and D.  Will notify Dr. Xie that pt is in-house per request of PCP, to determine if any further Rheum w/u is necessary.



3.	GI: Will repeat amylase and lipase.  Prednisone is a known cause of pancreatitis and pt's continued abdominal complaints may be pancreatic in origin. although unlikely as elevation is minimal.

CC: f/u visit for chest pain



HPI: Mr. Hooper has not had any further episodes of chest pain.  Negative enzymes and normal EKG on 3/12.  I recommended ETT to f/u on this but he misunderstood and didn't think he needed to have it done.  He reports that Dr. Gill in neurology suggested he might be a candidate for bariatric surgery.  He is going to be seeing Naomi Newberry in nutrition, who is now at the Manamana.

History of Present Illness: The patient presents today for follow up of his diabetes and heart disease, and to follow up as well as recent proximal humeral fracture that will not require surgery per his orthopedic specialist. The patient fell down a couple weeks ago on ice and landed on his left shoulder, sustaining a proximal humeral fracture that is currently well aligned. The patient was seen by orthopedics at the Boulder County Hospital, he was told to have no work for the next 3 months. He also received reports no chest pain, PND or orthopnea, he also denies any AICD firing, and reports only occasional low blood sugar reactions. He has a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, he currently uses NPH insulin 42 units daily with sliding scale to 3 times a day at a maximal 8 units at a time. He reports no polyuria or polydipsia. His only risk doctor for fracture includes a low testosterone diagnosed about 3 years ago. He is currently on no replacement for testosterone, and only recently started calcium and vitamin D after his fracture. He has not had an eye examination in over a year.

Assessment and Plan: 1. Proximal humeral fracture-the patient will be out of work for 3 months, and is really taking calcium and vitamin D twice a day, and strong he recommended a bone density test for future should fracture assessment given his low testosterone 3 years ago, the patient is not willing to schedule it today, but will call me in the next month to do so he is on Ultram on a p.r.n. basis with good relief of pain and he did not tolerate oxycodone well initially
2. Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes-will recommend hemoglobin A1c, lipid profile, and urine for microalbumin as well as a TSH, and considered poor the patient from NPH to Lantus or possible to 70/30 insulin, with the patient might ask her benefit with formal endocrine consultation given his poor glycemic control and history of cardiac disease.
3. CAD-will check his lipid panel tonight, aiming for an LDL of below 100

RE:  William Le

MRN:  054-00-99

DOB:  09/03/2089



DOS:  02/25/2163



Dear Dr Chavez,



Mr. William Le return for follow-up in the Neurology clinic today.  He still has significant difficulty walking, and he is falling frequently at home. He has not sustained any significant injuries.  He has numbness and paresthesias of his feet, but there has been no interval change in his symptoms since his last visit in November 2162.



Medications:  Neurontin 300mg TID, Lasix 40mg daily, aspirin, Atenolol 50mg daily, Zetia 10mg, Pravastatin 20mg, Nexium and multi vitamins.



Examination:  reveals that strength testing in the legs is normal.  He has absent deep tendon reflexes of the ankles, trace to 1+ at the knees.  Romberg's test is positive, and the patient has difficulty standing without assistance.  Despite the degree of sensory ataxia, he is still able to feel position sense at the metatarsophalangeal joints in his feet. Vibration and pinprick sensation are diminished.



Data Review:  The patient does have a persistent low concentration of monoclonal protein in the slow gamma region.  This is unchanged compared to the previous study done in February 2162. This most likely is a MGUS.



Impression and Recommendation:  The patient has poorly controlled diabetes, complicated by polyneuropathy.  The monoclonal protein is an incidental finding and is probably not accounting for his peripheral neuropathy.  Given that the monoclonal protein has not changed in concentration or character I do not believe that there is a need for additional testing at this stage.  He will continue with Neurontin to manage his neuropathic symptoms.  I have urged him to try and maintain good diabetic control. Follow-up in 6 months





Sincerely,







Charles Tisdale

Interval History:

   Mr. Vines is a 70 year old male who has experienced claudication for approximately five to six years.  He describes his claudication as bilateral shin pain which radiates up to his knees.  His symptoms have worsened over the past two to three years and are now limiting his lifestyle.  He is able to walk approximately two to three city blocks when the pain starts and is relieved with rest.  He denies rest symptoms.  He was recently evaluated by Dr. Curtis Cochran for his claudication syjmptoms.  After an extensive conversation and a review of hsi options, Mr. Vines decided to pursue catheter based revascularization.



He underwent adominal aortography and iliofemoral angiography today which demonstrated:

-grossly patent celiac axis, SMA and IMA

-single renal arteries bilaterally with ostial/proximal 65-70% stenosis on the left; the right renal artery has proximal 30% stenosis

NAME:     Oliver, Uriah 
MRN:       7916007

Primary Care Provider:  Dr. Patterson

Mr. Oliver returns for follow-up of several issues.

Weight 175.  Blood pressure 130/80. 

MEDICATIONS:   He finished Flagyl last night, and he took his last dose of levoflox
today.  Glyburide is on hold.  He is taking hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d., Lovastatin
20 mg q.d., fosinopril 40 mg q.d., verapamil SR 240 mg q.d., ASA 1 q.d., metoprolol
75 mg three times a day and Glucophage 1000 mg b.i.d.  

(1)  Diverticulitis and history of colon cancer.  

     S:   His pain is gone although he continues to have a bad taste in his mouth
          since he has been on antibiotics. 

     O:   His abdomen is soft with normal bowel sounds.  There is no tenderness
          today.  

     P:   He will need colonoscopy at the Atlantic North in a month or so. 

(2)  Diarrhea.  

     S:   He has continued to have several soft, dark bowel movements a day
          while he has been taking the antibiotic.  He has not seen any bright red
          blood per rectum.  He has been using Equal and eating ice cream.  

     O:   Stool for C. diff. and stool C&S were both negative. 

     P:   I asked him to discontinue artificial sweeteners and milk products,
          except for yogurt, for 3 days.  He will call if the diarrhea persists off the
          antibiotic.  

(3)  Guaiac-positive stool on examination last week.  

     O:   His hematocrit had increased to 35.7 last week.  

     P:   Recheck CBC.  He will bring me the name of his GI physician at the
          Atlantic North so that I can communicate with him about the recent events
          and arrange for follow-up colonoscopy.  

(4)  Dizziness.  

     S:   This has resolved. 

(5)  Diabetes. 

     S:   He stopped glyburide as directed last week when his 4 p.m. blood sugar
          was 44.  His fingerstick blood sugar was 192 this morning.  He reports
          that he is eating much better.  

     P:   He will restart glyburide 5 mg q.d. when his blood sugar is greater than
          200.

(6)  Systolic murmur and right bundle branch block.

     P:   His echocardiogram has been requested but he has not yet received the
          appointment.  

(7)  Coronary artery disease.  

     S:   He has had no chest pain.  He apparently had an appointment last week
          for an exercise tolerance test at the Atlantic North but the technician was
          not there.  He has another appointment later this week with the doctor
          at the Atlantic North.

     P:   I gave him a copy of the final NYSH discharge summary from his recent
          hospitalization as well as copies of the EKGs done during the
          hospitalization and a copy of the abdominal CT report to take to his
          doctor at the Atlantic North.

(8)  Proteinuria during the hospitalization. 

     O:   His serum creatinine was 1.5 (likely elevated given his age).  Repeat
          urinalysis showed 1+ albumin with no other significant abnormalities. 

     P:   Check 24-hour urine for protein and creatinine.  Check serum protein
          electrophoresis and urine immunoelectrophoresis. 

(9)  Chronic anemia.  

     O:   He had normal iron studies, B12 and folate several months ago.  His
          hematocrit was stable as of last week.  

     P:   Check serum protein electrophoresis and urine immunoelectrophoresis.  

(10) Decreased HDL.  

     A:   We could either add niacin or change his statin from Mevacor to Lipitor
          to increase the HDL.  

     P:   I have deferred this issue to his primary care physician. 

He will return for follow-up in 2 weeks so that we can make final arrangements for
the colonoscopy and to check progress with his diabetes.

Re:	Horn, Gregory

	BCC Unit #: 977-82-23



Dear Dr. Givens:



I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Horn, in follow-up regarding possible interstitial lung disease. 



He has managed to lose 3 lbs. on his own personal diet plan, and feels his diabetes is coming under slightly better control.



His cough is virtually gone and now has only rare cough with a little bit of phlegm, grading it as 2 out of 10 vs. 8-9 out of 10, to which his wife agrees.  They both attribute it to the Prilosec.



He now sleeps well and does not use his wedge.  He has no snoring, daytime hypersomnolence, or morning headaches - no longer falls asleep at work.



Allergies and nasal congestion are not evident.



No lower extremity edema, swollen glands, or fevers.



Mildly less prominent exertional breathlessness - He now occasionally has to go up one flight of stairs without stopping.



On examination, he is well appearing.  Respiratory rate 22 and unlabored. Blood pressure 90/50 with a small cuff. Conjunctivae are clear.  Oropharynx is clear. Trachea is midline, no goiter or adenopathy. Back:  Normal configuration.  Chest:  Normal percussion note, good air movement bilaterally; fine expiratory crackles at the lateral bases.  Cardiac:  Faint left parasternal impulse, mildly prominent P2, normal S1, S2, without murmur, rub, or gallop.  JVP is 7 cm with borderline HJR.  Abdomen: Soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass. Extremities:  No cyanosis or edema, borderline clubbing.



Pulmonary function tests today show very stable values per spirometry, a slight down-   ..  in total lung capacity, but still approximately 70% predicted, and DLCO stable in the 60% predicted range.



My review of CT scan of the chest shows faint peripheral subpleural reticular pattern with cyst formation and no significant nodules.  



Impression:



1.	Interstitial lung disease - Mild objective impairment by functional status.  Pulmonary function tests - Overall, these were stable, and the CT scan is quite suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis.  However, as I reviewed with the patient and his wife, it is well established that 10% of the time, another disorder, such as occult hypersensitivity pneumonitis or nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis can be found on lung biopsy.  There is no evidence of a rheumatologic disorder nor any evidence of chronic aspiration, other than that associated with GE reflux, to explain his lung disease.  He would be a very reasonable candidate for gamma interferon, although this likely would necessitate low-dose steroids - the latter treatment would certainly have an impact on his diabetes.



2.	GE reflux - This is the main source of his cough and is well established to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis.  If he is able to lose weight and change his lifestyle, he can have very good control of this.



3.	Possible mild pulmonary hypertension related to the pulmonary fibrosis.



4.	Possible sleep disorder - Currently is entirely without symptoms, now that his reflux is well controlled.



5.	Chronic cough.



6.	Diabetes - Better controlled.



7.	Obesity - He continues to need aggressive weight loss program.  As I mentioned to him, he would not be a candidate for lung transplantation evaluation while he is at such as weight, but he is starting to make some progress.



Recommendations:



1.	Continue proton pump inhibitor at b.i.d. dosing, as well as lifestyle modifications, including marked decrease in caffeine intake.



2.	Referral to Dr. Harry Yerger for VATS lung biopsy.



3.	Cardiovascular evaluation by you, prior to his surgery, would be appreciated.



It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.  Please feel free to call with any questions or comments.



Sincerely, 





Paul N. Tam, M.D.

Referring Physician:  Dr. Kenyon, Dr. Elmer Ure, Vallejo General 
Cardiology.  
 
Referring Diagnosis: Status post cardiac transplant. Rule out 
osteoporosis.  
 
HPI:  Patient is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of lymphoma, 
diagnosed in 2070 when he presented with left axillary enlargement.  At 
the time, he was staged by bone marrow transplant which was negative.  
Whether this was a Hodgkin's or non-Hodgki's lymphoma is unclear to us, 
but he was treated with bleomycin, adriamycin and prednisone for 
approximately 26 weeks.  At that point, he was believed to be in 
remission and stayed in remission since then.  
 
In 2077, the patient was first diagnosed with diabetes mellitus when he 
presented with polyuria, polydipsia and blurred vision.  Subsequently he 
was treated with oral hypoglycemic agents for one to two years and since 
that time has been on insulin therapy, currently on 64 units of NPH and 
six of regular in the morning with 30 NPH and six of regular pre-supper.  
He currently checks his blood sugars four times a day and runs in the 
100-200 range with average being about 130 and is followed by Dr. Nicodemus 
Paz of Queenstown, WI, his primary care doctor, for this.  The patient's 
complications of diabetes mellitus are possibly non-existent.  There is 
no peripheral neuropathy.  There is no autonomic neuropathy.  No retinal 
disease.  However, the patient does have renal disease, with baseline 
creatinine currently of 2.4.  
 
Recently the patient developed congestive heart failure with initial 
symptoms in the early 80s.  By June of 2082, the patient had fairly 
severe symptoms requiring hospitalizations and in the period of July 
2082 to June of 2083, the patient apparently had 5 myocardial 
infarctions.  In June 2083, the patient underwent orthotopic cardiac 
transplant here at the VGH under the care of Dr. Quentin Fitzpatrick.  Since 
that time, the patient has done very well without evidence of rejection 
with relatively good exercise tolerance and with basically a minimum 
degree of symptoms.  
 
The patient's current medications include cyclosporine 150 mg. twice a 
day; prednisone 8 mg. a day.  Azathioprine 250 mg. a day; Axid 150 mg. 
twice a day; Cardizem 300 mg. a day; baby aspirin once a day; Cardura 4 
mg. once a day; and amitriptyline 25 mg. a day for cramping in his legs.  
 
Review of Systems:  Has had one fracture of his right ring finger that 
was from a trauma some years ago.  Other past medical history includes 
history of sleep apnea and depression and the things mentioned.

Family History:  His sister, aged 54, and mother, have osteoporosis with 
his mother having fairly severe osteoporosis with a normal of vertebral 
collapses and some nerve damage.  His father and mother have had 
diabetes mellitus, his father dying of heart disease.  There is a 
19-year-old daughter who has a history of migraines.  There is no 
history of thyroid disease in the family.
 
Social History:  He currently works at Belkin and has a desk job 
there.  He quit smoking and drinking 15-20 years ago.  He has been 
married for over 20 years.  His review of symptoms revealed the absence 
of GI symptoms.  There were no orthostatic symptoms, no angina.  Normal 
sexual function.  He denied any skin problems or rashes.  He denied 
numbness and tingling in his feet, etc.  There is a history of 
hypertension.  
 
Other review of systems:  His height has been stable at 6'2"" tall.  
 
Physical Examination:  Blood pressure 130/93.  Heart rate 96.   The 
patient is a well-appearing gentleman, somewhat obese.  His height is 
6'2"".  Weight 294 lbs. which is apparently steadily been increasing.  He 
has a mild Cushingoid appearance with a little bit of posterior cervical 
and supraclavicular fat.  Retina appeared without lesions.  Normal 
extra-ocular movements.  His oral mucosa was moist without evidence of 
thrush.  Neck exam:  He had a supple neck with no carotid bruits.  
Normal thyroid.   His chest exam revealed clear lung fields with normal 
excretion.  There was no bony tenderness or abnormalities on his back.  
His cardiac exam:  He had a soft, S1, S2.  Cardiac exam otherwise 
unremarkable.  His abdomen was soft.  He had some evidence of insulin 
injections, but no significant hypertrophy.  He injects both in his 
abdomen and rotates with his arms.  His extremities revealed minimal 
stasis dermatitis, normal pulses, and were symmetric.  No edema.  
Neurologically he was diffusely hyporeflexic.  He had normal to slightly 
decreased vibratory sensation in his big toes.  
 
Laboratory Exam:  Most recent laboratories that I could find were 
February 09, 2084.  Sodium 141.  K 5.1; chloride 105.  Bicarb 20.  BUN 
39.  Creatinine 3.4; glucose 136.  His CK was 219.  Calcium 9.7.  
Albumin 4.3; phosphate 4.0.  Alkaline phosphatase was 90.  Uric acid 
5.1; magnesium 1.9.  TSH was 1.6.  Cholesterol 242.  Triglycerides 226.  
His cyclosporine level was in the therapeutic range at 273.  His CBC 
revealed a hematocrit of 43 and a white count of 8.9 thousand with a 
normal differential.  
 
Assessment and Plan:  This is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of 
multiple medical problems.  The one's most pertinent to us currently are

the fact that he is post-transplant, has several risk factors for 
osteoporosis, including prednisone use and a family history of 
osteoporosis.  The total amount of exposure to prednisone sounds like it 
is about a year-and-a-half or so with half a year during his 
chemotherapy 14 years ago and then about a year since his transplant.  
The patient's history of never having had fractures, no bone pain, no 
height loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might 
be somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant 
patients.  However, getting a bone density study in the patient like 
this makes sense.  We will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on 
his follow up visit, since he cannot have one today for scheduling 
reasons.  We will also check vitamin D levels given patient's history of 
renal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to 
do for him is to give him vitamin D.  His calcium intake was estimated 
to be about 1,000 mg. a day including one cup of milk, green leafy 
vegetables and one cup of ice cream each day.  We would be a little 
reticent about starting higher doses of calcium given his renal failure, 
without more information about this patient.  The patient's diabetes 
seems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugars under 
fairly good control, sounding like they are in the 130 range although we 
don't have access to hemoglobin A1C.  Given the fact that it sounds like 
he has got pretty good care by Dr. Paz, we will not pursue this at 
the current time unless asked, and we will focus primarily on the bone 
situation.  Otherwise, we will see the patient back or at least talk to

Reason for consult: nausea and epigastric pain

Referring MD: Dr. 

ID/CC:  52yoF with DM s/p recent cholecystectomy for nausea here with recurrent nausea/vomiting

HPI:   Pt with DM presenting with 6 weeks of N/V, beginning on 12/26/80 when she had green emesis, then abdominal pain.  Was seen in ED at OSH and sent home.  She continued to vomit, went to another hospital where she stayed for a week, and had a cholecystectomy.  She felt better at home for 4 days after discharge, but had recurrent vomiting, back to ED, admitted again and discharged after a week-long stay.  She now comes to PSH after four episodes of emesis yesterday.

	Pt reports intermittent periumbilical pain, which worsens right before a bout of emesis, then dies down after the emesis.  Pain does not radiate; pt not able to characterize frequency, duration, or quality of the pain.  No obvious relationship between pain and PO intake.

	In between episodes of vomiting, she feels increased amount of secretions in her mouth that she has to spit out.  Denies any dysphagia or odynophagia.  No melena or hematochezia.  Had had constipation, which resolved with laxatives, more recently having 2 BMs/day.

	She does not recall the workup at OSH but thinks she may have had EGD and colonoscopy already, which she reports did not show any abnormality.



ROS:  no fever or night sweats.  No odynophagia or dysphagia.  No rash.  No CP, SOB, LE edema.  Appetite was good and no weight changes before 12/26/80; since then, she is afraid to eat and has lost weight and feels    weak

	evidence of free air.

	There is no retroperitoneal, mesenteric or inguinal

	lymphadenopathy. 

A/P:     52yoF with DM with six weeks of recurrent green emesis and periumbilical pain without abdominal distention or KUB or CT signs of obstruction.  Question of TI thickening and gastric thickening (but may appear that way only due to underdistention).  As per pt, she has had EGD and colonoscopy at OSH already.  Would suggest obtaining records from Fairview-Southdale Hospital first before decision regarding repeat w/u here.  Workup may entail gastric emptying scan to assess for gastroparesis, EGD and colonoscopy to evaluate for malignancy or IBD, brain imaging to r/o CNS process.  Can continue to try Reglan 10mg up to QID.



Will staff with Dr. Otis Aguilera later today.

diarrhea, no abdominal pain, and no palpitations.  The patient does 

report some mild shortness of breath.  The chest pressure is not 

acute in onset.  There is no exacerbation with activity.  She had a 

negative exercise tolerance test four years ago.  Since being here, 

she has received some improvement in her symptoms after 

nitroglycerin.  She has no known coronary disease.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation and insulin-dependent 

diabetes mellitus.

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient is an active smoker 

and lives alone.  No family history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient is hemodynamically stable, nontoxic, 

well appearing, resting comfortably.  NECK:  No jugulovenous 

distention.  LUNGS:  Clear.  HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  

ABDOMEN:  Soft.  NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  White count is 7.8, hematocrit 41.  Normal 

electrolyte panel.  Troponin I is 0.3 which is elevated.  CK is 160 

which is normal.  The EKG shows some flattening T wave laterally 

which is old.  A chest x-ray shows no effusion, infiltrate, or 

pneumothorax.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient has a positive troponin 

here and will be admitted.  She will be heparinized __________ 

started.  See resident's note for details.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:  

1.  Rule out myocardial infarction.

2.  Chest tightness.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 

admitted to the hospital in stable condition.

Narrative History

Pt reutrns for f/u.

She has not been taking lipitor for several weeks as ran out and did not refull Rx. 

She has had R shoulder pain for about one month. Pain is an aching quality, minimally alleviated by tylenol, exacerbated by moving rotating shoulder. Does not have frozen shoulder or sensation of morning stiffness. She is able to continue all IADL activities requiring use of the joint but notes the pain has become increasingly bothersome. She notes no weakness of her R arm, no dysesthesias or paresthesias, swelling, or history of injury. 

She has noted burning pain in lower extremities, stocking distribution x 1 year. She has pain described as ""pins"" from bottom of foot extending up both legs. She has a burning sensation of both legs that she notices particularly at night. Walking does not exacerbate or alleviate this sensation. She has not used anything to relieve the discomfort. She has no symptoms of claudication, no reported cyanosis of her LE digits, and no LE edema.

Assessment and Plan

1. Shoulder pain.

Impingement sign, pain with cross over manouver, and pain with use of shoulder to extend arm are consistent with rotator cuff injury. 

Check shoulder films to exclude acromioclavicular injury or degenerative process.

Renew Vioxx prescription (avoiding NSAIDs) in this patient on prednisone, at risk for gastritis.

2. CAD.

Pt had negative stress MIBI in 12/91 and has not had cardiology follow up for multiple years. She is being referred to the Internal Medicine ward service for consultation. Specifically, she remains on a nitrate (isordil) which may exacerbate GERD. She also merits being placed on an ACE inhibitor to prevent reinfarction.

She is well beta blocked and her BP is well controlled by the current regimen of atneolol and isordil.

Checking fasting lipids.

3. SLE.

She is being followed by Dr. Xie.

She and I are curious about her prednisone dosing and I will discuss the regimen with Dr. Xie. 

4. Prednisone.

Had BD of hip last year which was negative; continues on calcium/vitamin D.

Needs further monitoring of HgbA1C as elevated from prior measurements and hyperglycemic from steroids.

5. Mammogram.

Ordered this visit for routine HCM.

6. Pain control.

She has multiple complaints of chronic pain which are not documented in this note. She has used Vioxx previously and needs Stuart Hospital authorization which is being sought following this visit.

7. GERD. 

Well-controlled with new regimen of Protonix 40 BID.

8. LE dysesthesias.

Remeasuring A1C but unlikely to have microvascular complications without overt DM.

Starting amitriptyline. Pt educated to take prior to sleep and will reassess if sx alleviated.

9. F/u.

Pt will follow up with me in 3-4 months.

 John V. Hood, M.D.



Attending note:

Pt seen and discussed with Dr. Hood, and agree with his evaluation and plan.

Pt with symptoms and signs of impingement syndrome due to rotator cuff tendinitis vs partial tear, and also tenderness and positive cross-over test c/w A-C arthritis. Will check X-ray, get PA for Vioxx, and would benefit from PT referral. If no improvement, consider MRI vs empiric subacromial/?A-C joint steroid injection.

Seems to have a painful peripheral neuropathy, cause uncertain. Will try low-dose TCA, would also check B12, consider EMG/NCV.

Will obtain cardiology review for CAD. Regardless of level of lipids, there is evidence for benefit of statin, and would encourage pt to resume. If current chest pain syndrome more likely due to GERD than ischemia, could consider D/C nitrates.

This patient was seen with Dr. Nabor Jacoby.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 29 year old woman with diabetes and 
obesity.  Her problems are as follows:
 
1.   Diabetes.  She was sent to me from OB/GYN because of her high glucose 
     and she was put on insulin by me.  Xitlali Xia followed her in 
     order to get her on a good dose but then she was lost to follow up as 
     she did not come to her appointments and did not return phone calls.  
     She finally comes back and I am relieved, but she has not brought any 
     list of her blood sugars.  She says she does take them about twice a 
     day and she did write them down but her daughter ripped them up and 
     threw them away.  She says that they never go higher than 200; that 
     they usually are about 110.  It was 101 this morning before 
     breakfast, she says.  She says it does get as low as 19 and five or 
     six times it has been below 50.  She does say she eats three regular 
     meals but then later in the morning when I asked her if she had eaten 
     breakfast she said no.  She is seeing a nutritionist this morning.
 
     I will check a hemoglobin A1C today.  I expressed to her again how 
     important it is that she eat three regular meals, but not sweets.  
     She had been eating a lot of chocolate.  She says she has gotten off 
     of a lot of this although she does have cravings for it and eats it 
     then.  She is going to a nutritionist today and I hope that she will 
     help her with her diet.  If her diet does get better, maybe we can 
     wean her off the insulin and try Micronase.  I explained to her, too, 
     that if she both had a good diet and lost some weight that we might 
     be able to get her off the insulin.  This seemed to be something that 
     she would like to do.  Hopefully the nutritionist can help.  I also 
     told her that in order to find out what was going on that I need her 
     to take her blood sugar before breakfast, lunch, dinner and sleep, 
     and then come back in a week and a half so that we can see what was 
     really going on and whether they are getting too low.  She denies any 
     kind of symptoms with even as low a blood sugar as 19.  I am 
     wondering if she is remembering all these blood sugars correctly.  
     She had no shakiness, no loss of consciousness, no dizziness, no 
     nothing.  She felt totally normal.  So hopefully she will really 
     record these and we will get a better idea.  She said this always 
     happens in the morning.  She kept contradicting herself and had no 
     documentation.  I went over with her the symptoms of hypoglycemia.  
     Once she had a low blood sugar by fingerstick.  She does drink juice, 
     but I went over the symptoms again with her.  She will call me if she 
     does have any.
                                              10-19-86
 
 
 
2.   Left ankle pain.  I sent her to the orthopedist as she requested.  
     She said that she may do some surgery on her.
 
3.   Dysuria.  She says this is totally resolved after giving her the 
     Bactrim.
 
4.   Yeast infection.  She said this has also resolved.
 
5.   She complains of headache.  She says these have been going on for two 
     or three months; that light and noise bother her when she has some.  
     She has had nausea and vomited once.  This happened pretty much every 
     day and it can be at any time of the day.  Tylenol and Advil did not 
     help.  She knows she is going to have a headache because it starts in 
     the back of her left ear very faintly and then it spreads from there.  
     But she has no further prodrome.  She says it is a banging kind of 
     pain that is rhythmic.  She also says she does see stars in front of 
     her eyes when it happens.  I asked her if she had any hearing loss, 
     and she said that she hears voices but people are not there 
     sometimes.  It has been happening for a couple of weeks.  I discussed 
     this with Dr. Jacoby and we both agreed that these do sound like 
     migraines.  I will not image her head now as there is no evidence 
     that this would be something to do with brain tumor.  Her neuro exam 
     was totally normal.  Cranial nerves II-XII were checked and intact.  
     Her gait was normal.  Light touch was touched.  Her toes were 
     downgoing.  Her reflexes were symmetric bilaterally.  Her disks were 
     sharp.  EOMI, PERRL.  I gave her a prescription for Motrin, 600 mg PO 
     t.i.d. and told her to take one the minute she got the pain behind 
     her left ear.  I will see her in a week and a half to reassess this.
 
6.   Health maintenance.  I thought that since she is diabetic and obese 
     that she might benefit from a flu shot.  She has no interest in this 
     at all.  Her blood pressure was 110/70 in the left arm with a thigh 
     cuff.  Her pulse was 96.  Her blood sugar was 151 and her weight was 
     285.

	CARDIOLOGY

	

	FAMILY HEALTH CLINIC

	



	Interval History:

   His customary dyspnea persists, but otherwise, nothing is new.  No chest discomfort.  No PND or orthopnea.



Medications:  Aspirin 325 mg qd, Lipitor 10 mg qd, Diovan 160 mg qd



Physical examination:  Reveals him to be well appearing. His BP is 111/50 and his heart rate is 68 and regular. He is 176 pounds.  There is no jugular venous distention and carotid pulses are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.  His lungs are clear throughout, and notably demonstrate only very slight dullness at the left base.  His sternotomy is healing well and is stable.  His apical impulse is non-displaced with a slightly irregular rate and rhythm, a normal S1 and S2.  He has an S3 gallop.  No murmur.  His abdomen is benign without hepatosplenomegaly, bruits, or a dilated aorta.  There is no pedal edema and posterior tibial pulses are 2+ bilaterally.



EKG:  NSR with a 1st degree AV block.  He has a narrow QRS with an old ASMI. Compared, the LBBB is no longer evident.



Impression:



1.CAD, s/p MI: currently stable.  Symptoms of dyspnea may be an ischemic equivalent, though, so I will give him a nitropatch.



2. Hypertension: under good control.



3.Hypercholesterolemia: controlled



4. Dyspnea: I suspect he has an element of diastolic dysfunction together with age-related deconditioning and chronic lung disease.  Nitrates might help the former issue.

DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: 



CXR: 

	No CHF.  On the lateral view only there is some increased patchy

	opacity in the posterior clear space which could represent

	developing atelectasis or, in the proper clinical setting, could

	represent a subtle focus focus of pneumonia.  There is new

	blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles consistent with a

	small amount of pleural fluid.



Abdominal Ultrasound:

NEGATIVE STUDY.



Exercise Stress Test:

  No ST segment changes were observed during this test.

        Arrhythmias:

          None.

        Comments:

        Fair exercise capacity. At peak exercise, patient complained of

        indigestion feeling relieved by belching after several minutes.

        Negative for ischemia.



EKG: 

NSR.  New TWI in V2, q in III, normal axis and intervals, no ST changes

	          	          

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:



The patient is a 74 yo female with poorly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presents with acute closed angle glaucoma and nausea and vomiting. 



1.	Glaucoma.



Likely secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy.  As recommended by the ophthalmologic consultant, I will give the following meds

	-Xalatan qHS

-Pred Forte QID

-Timolol BID

-Trusopt BID

-Acetazolamide BID

-Alphagan

IOP will be monitored closely.  If it does not trend down, the patient may need surgery in the AM.



2.	Nausea and Vomiting



The differential diagnosis is broad and includes symptoms related to glaucoma, atypical angina, symptoms from an SBO given her history, chemical pancreatitis and viral gastroenteritis.  Of these, I believe that symptoms from glaucoma or gastroenteritis is most likely.  

-	I ordered a KUB on the floor which showed normal bowel gas per unofficial rads read.  

-	I think angina is unlikely given her history.  However, I believe that she needs a stress test given her severe diabetes.  I will be unable to arrange one for tomorrow (weekend day), but I believe she needs one as an out patient study in the near future.  I will give ASA, B blocker and ACE.  I will not give heparin given that her TIMI score is only 1. 

-	Chemical pancreatitis is possible although her exam is so bengin. I will therefore give pt full liqs tonight and follow her for pancreatitis symptoms.



3.	Chronic Renal Failure



This is likely secondary to diabetic nephropathy. Pt is at baseline creatinine



4.	Anemia



Pt is at baseline creatinine.  She was found to have sickle cell trait.  Iron studies, B12, folate WNL. Hct stable



5.	Diabetes



Will continue NPH and Regular insulin and cover with SSI.



6.	Prophylaxis



On nexium.  Holding heparin prophylaxis because the patient is ambulatory.

MAH CANCER CENTER



NAME:  Danny Nielson 

MAH#:  915-65-93

DATE OF VISIT:  November 10, 2097



REASON FOR VISIT:  



Mr. Nielson is a 77-year-old gentleman with Stage IIIB diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin s lymphoma who is status post four cycles of CHOP-R chemotherapy with persistent disease (documented by PET and biopsy).  He underwent salvage with two cycles of R-ICE and unfortunately continued to have PET avidity in the area.  As a result, we scheduled him to begin therapy with Zevalin next Monday.  He is here for a follow up physical and count check to make sure he has adequate platelets for this immunotherapy.  



INTERVAL HISTORY:



He describes an episode approximately one week ago of sudden onset of shortness of breath and tightness in his chest.  He sat down for approximately 10 minutes, it resolved, and has not recurred since then. However, we also have the reports of a follow up PET/CT scan which was performed yesterday which show a new accumulation of bilateral pleural effusions which the radiologist feels are most consistent with heart failure.  In addition, the scans also showe the prior area of PET avidity in the leg continues, although less avid. This area is in the medial compartment of the left thigh within the adductor muscles.  Mr. Nielson is not excited about this.  In addition, we also have results from laboratories today which show his platelets at 88,000, so  he is not eligible to begin Zevalin next week.  



MEDICATIONS:  



glyburide 10 mg 

atorvastatin 10 mg daily

furosemide 40 mg daily

multiple vitamin daily

prednisone 5 mg daily

Tylenol p.r.n.

Bactrim DS q. Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  



Weight is 260 pounds, temperature is 97.1 degrees, heart rate is 120, blood pressure is 130/80, and respiratory rate is 20.  Pain index is 0/10.  Fatigue index is 5/10.  Heart rate is tachycardic with an ejection murmur and occasional missed beats.  Lungs do have reduced breath sounds bilaterally.  



LABORATORY STUDIES:  



White blood cell count is 3.2, hematocrit is 33.5, hemoglobin is 11.4, platelet count 88,000, neutrophil count is 2.45.  Chemistries examination reveals sodium of 141, potassium of 3, chloride of 104, carbon dioxide of 28.3, calcium of 9.1, BUN of 24, creatinine of 1.6, total protein 6.3, albumin of 3.7, total bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 58, SGPT of 21, SGOT of 22, and LDH of 208.  



ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  



Given his current status, we have decided to transfer him to the emergency department today for further evaluation of his cardiac symptoms, particularly to rule out myocardial infarction and assess whether he is, indeed, in new heart failure  We attempted to contact cardiology for an outpatient evaluation, but we were unable to do so.Therefore, he will be transported to the emergency department for an emergent workup of his new symptoms.  I suspect he will be admitted.  Hopefully, they will be able to get his cardiac issues under control.  Unfortunately, from an oncologic point of view, it is uncertain whether his platelet count will reach at least 100,000 in order to give this man therapy.  As a potential other therapy, we will discuss the ability of radiation oncology to increase the number of cGy to that local area considering he only received 30 at the onset.

RENAL CONSULT NOTE 
 
It is a pleasure seeing seeing Ms. Yount in consultation.  She was referred to us by Dr. Michael.  Ms. Yount has a history of diabetes mellitus for the last seven years.  She also has a long history of hypertension.  She retired from IBM in 2085 after working there for many years.  Her last posting was as a electrical mechanic.  She is feeling well.  She denies headaches, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  She also denies shortness of breath or complex partial seizures.  She denies swelling and presence of dysuria, fever, chills.  She is taking her medications regularly.  
 
ALLERGIES 
No known drug allergies.  
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY 
1.  Diabetes mellitus for about seven years.  
2.  Hypertension.  

3.  PVD

4.  Hypercholesterolemia

 
SOCIAL HISTORY 
She denies smoking or drinking.  She has one son living with her.


FAMILY HISTORY 
Positive for diabetes.  
 
MEDICATIONS 
Norvasc 10 mg q. day,

Glucophage 500 mg twice a day,

Glucotrol 5 mg twice a day,

Avandia 4 mg q. day, (she had incresed skin itching with attempts to increase the dose)

Lipitor 10 mg q. day,

Aspirin 325 mg a day (she is not taking aspirin).   


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS 
Ms. Yount denies any recent visual change, headaches.  She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, fever, chills.   


PHYSICAL EXAM 
Ms. Yount looks well.  Blood pressure is 148/90.  Body weight is 188.  Repeat blood pressure is 170/80.  On examination of head and neck - no absolutely.  Thyroid is soft, nontender, no nodules.  Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.  Heart - regular rate and rhythm, no S3.  Abdomen is soft, bowel sounds present.  Extremities - trace edema.  
 
LABORATORY 
Pending.  
 
IMPRESSION 
Ms. Yount has diabetes and hypertension with a mildly elevated creatinine.  Her urine shows presence of protein, which suggests diabetic nephropathy.  Upon review of her medications, she is on a very good medication control, and  her blood pressure has been well controlled.  However, today the blood pressure is running higher.  I will see her in about two to three months.  If her blood pressure continues to be high, we should try to increase her dose of ARB.  I also explained to Ms. Yount the importance of taking aspirin and that she should continue her daily aspirin.

NEUROLOGY RESIDENT CONSULT NOTE 





PATIENT NAME: Dalila Haynes
MRN: 78361343
DATE OF CONSULT: 1/30/04



 
Consulted by: ED for altered mental status and generalized weakness



HPI:   

69 yo F h/o systemic sarcoidosis (extensive adenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and adrenal glands, and has been on corticosteroids), CNS syphillis s/p treatment  who presents with several weeks increasing generalized weakness and several days of increasing confusion. Patient is unable to give a reliable history; history from daughter Inez Haynes, whom I called on the phone, and from LMR (primarily Dr. Keondre Viera's August neurology note). Her daughter reports that current decline is similar to her presentation in July 2103.


She was hospitalized at Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss that had progressed over 1 to 2 months. Head CT on 7/25/03 with only mild ventriculomegaly. An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus. There was no abnormal enhancement. This was consistent with small vessel stroke. EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features. She had normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20). CSF HSV PCR was negative. HbA1C was elevated at 8.6. An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC. CSF ACE was normal. Cultures were negative. CSF VDRL was negative. She was initially treated with prednisone 40 mg daily tapered down to 10 mg daily. In follow up, it was noted that RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab. This was thought to represent neurosyphillis and she was admitted and treated w/ 14 days of IV penicillin. Prednisone was subsequently tapered to off since her presentation was thought to be consistent w/ neurosyphillis and not neurosarcoidosis.



Per her daughter, patient had improved back to being independent of ADL's and walking with a cane witout assistance. Over the last few weeks, she has gotten progressively more weak with multiple falls. Has trouble standing now, seems unsteady on her feet, has been primarily in bed for the last few days, requiring assistance to get to the bathroom or she falls down. Over the last several days, she has become even more globally weak and confused. She has been talking about relatives who are not in the house, thinking that they are there; thinking that the closet is the bathroom. It was a slow progression over a few weeks and then accelerated over the last few days. Patient reports intermittent headaches.


On presentation to the ED, she was noted to be tachycardic in the 120's (baseline resting tachycardia documented for many months, being worked up by cards), normotensive, afebrile, oriented x 2, and moving all extremities. 


 
ROS: 
Reliability of ROS is questionable.
Neurologic: Except as above, there have been no changes in vision or hearing, neck pain, tinnitus, vertigo, numbness, speaking, language, swallowing, or gait.



General: negative for fevers, chills, rashes, change in weight, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and change in bowel or bladder habits.



PMH:   
1. Hypertension. 
2. Diabetes.
3. Systemic sarcoidosis
4. CNS syphilis status post treatment.
5. Osteoarthritis.
6. Thyroid nodules.
7. Bilateral adrenal adenomas.
8. Osteopenia.

IMAGING:
HEAD CT TODAY:
There is no midline shift, mass effect, evidence of acute territorial infarction, or hemorrhage. Ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with stable involutional change. There is no hydrocephalus. Chronic periventricular white matter changes are again noted. There is no significant soft tissue swelling or calvarial fracture. Prominent calcifications of a falx cerebri are incidentally noted. Imaged portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. There is bilateral exophthalmus.
      
CXR: today
Faint opacity seen in the retrocardiac region which  could represent early pneumonia. Clinical correlation and interval follow-up is recommended.


EKG: sinus tachy. no ST changes or Q waves. 



ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: 

69 yo F h/o systemic sarcoidosis (extensive adenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and adrenal glands, and has been on corticosteroids), CNS syphillis s/p treatment  who presents with several weeks of increasing generalized weakness and several days of increasing confusion. Exam notable for poor memory and some confusion about recent events.  Labs are unremarkable except minor electrolyte abnormalities. Head CT unremarkable. Her prior presentation was thought to be most likely due to neurosyphillis as detailed above, though there was still the possibility of neurosarcoid. She has not had a repeat LP to assess for resolution of prior abnormalities, and now that she has a recurrence of symptoms, she should have repeat LP. She should also have an MRI as a thalamic or frontal stroke is another possible etiology. This could be a more global failure to thrive in the setting of deconditioning followed by poor PO's, but this should be a diagnosis of exclusion. CXR raises a question of retrocardiac opacity suggesting possible PNA, but with normal WBC, no URI sx's or cough, and no fever, I think it is unlikely that she has PNA and will follow clinically.


-check her gait
-check ESR



-LP for standard studies and save 5-10 cc for additional studies depending on cell count/TP
-MRI of the brain
-EEG
-further lab w/u pending LP results
-remove foley catheter
-PT consult

Mr. Geiger is a 74 year old man who comes in today for follow up of his 
blood pressure medication as well as his cholesterol level.  I have been 
readjusting Mr. Geiger's blood pressure regimen since he left Hale Memorial Hospital for an episode of gastroenteritis and hypovolemia 
several months ago.  His blood pressure regimen currently is HCTZ 25mg 
q.d., lisinopril, 20mg q.d. and atenolol 25mg q.d.  He apparently went 
to an office visit at Dr. Mueller office a week ago and was noted there 
to have high blood pressure.  She prescribed an increase in his atenolol 
from 25mg to 50mg.  He has not yet completed that prescription.  Mr. 
Geiger's blood pressure today is 180/80.  He denies any recent chest 
pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness or other symptoms.  

Mr. Geiger's cholesterol was checked by me last visit due to a modestly 
elevated cholesterol one year ago which had not been treated.  His 
current cholesterol level was total 283, HDL 54, LDL 196.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Mr. Geiger denies any recent fever, chills, 
headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, dysuria.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 180/80.  His weight is 184.  
His heart rate is 80.  Lung exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  
The cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2, no 
murmurs.  Abdominal exam is benign.  Extremities show no evidence of 
edema.  

Recent laboratories show a chem 7 panel of sodium 141, potassium 4.5, 
chloride 101, bicarb 29, BUN 11, creatinine 1.1, glucose 124.  He has a 
normal liver function test and normal calcium and magnesium.  His T4 is 
normal at 10.3.  His THBR is normal at 0.98.  

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
1.   Hypertension.  Mr. Geiger's blood pressure continues to be elevated 
     despite his current regimen of HCTZ and lisinopril and atenolol.  
     He was recently given an increased atenolol dose from Dr. Mueller.  
     I agree with this decision and will wait for him to fill his 
     prescription and begin this new regimen before he follows up in a 
     few weeks for blood pressure check.  
2.   Cholesterol.  The patient's cholesterol is significantly elevated.  
     Given his comorbidities, I would aim for an LDL level less than 
     130.  Thus, I will begin a course of atorvastatin.  His current 
     liver function tests are normal.

3.   Health maintenance.  I have recommended to him losing some weight.  
     He has gained 6 pounds since his visits last month.  He attributes 
     this to his holiday eating, but he says that he gets a good deal of 
     exercise.  I will continue to recommend diet and exercise for him.  
     He has most recently competed a Pneumovax and a flu vaccine last 
     week.

Thomas Ho, M.D.  
Saint Davids Pavilion 
Internal Medicine 
Walton, IL 14418 
 
RE: LINDSAY, Anastasha 
SDP#: 5563788 
 
Dear Dr. Ho:  
 
I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Lindsay today in follow up at the Saint Davids Pavilion Neurology. I last saw her on 07/27/2112. She is a 72-year-old woman who is status post a right MCA distribution cortical infarct in April of 2112 with residual left hand weakness. Since I last saw her Mrs. Lindsay has not done very well. She has had multiple recent falls and her gait has become even more unsteady. She tends to veer to either side and does have a frequent feeling of lightheadedness. She has hit her head on a couple of occasions with these falls. 

  
Of note her blood pressure medication has been essentially doubled since I last saw her. She is now taking 10 mg of Zestril every day instead of five and taking Atenolol 50 mg q.d. instead of 25 mg p.o. q.d. She does have intermittent weakness of the left hand which is likely recrudescent of her prior stroke symptoms and not new strokes. She does not have discoordination, vertigo or diplopia. She does have intermittent chest pains as well which she loath to bring to the attention of her physician.  She is reluctant to use a cane because her family states that ""her husband does not use a cane and he is older, why should she have to use a cane"". She has been switched to Plavix 75 mg p.o.  q.d. from aspirin. This was done without my knowledge as well.  She continues to have difficulty ""feeling my feet"" and this has been a chronic problem for her as well.  
 
On examination she is alert. She is a garrulous and tangential historian and needs to be frequently refocussed. Her speech is fluent in English. English is her second language and she is less fluent in that language. Her visual fields are full to confrontation. Her extraocular movements are full with no nystagmus. Her face is symmetric other than a mild left nasolabial fold flattening. She has a mild left pronator drift and slowed finger tapping on the left side. She has no ataxia on finger-to-nose-to-finger testing. Her gait is slightly wide-based and unsteady. She can veer to either side and frequently has to hold on to someone next to her for stability.  
 
IMPRESSION: I do not feel that Mrs. Lindsay has had a new embolic event, however I am quite concerned about her continued falling and difficulty with both her continued peripheral neuropathy and likely hypoperfusion. This appears to be pressure dependent and I would suggest that we back off on her antihypertensive medications at this time. In looking at her recent CBCs she has also been consistently anemic and with her complaints of chronic fatigue I think this could certainly be a factor. Atenolol could certainly be a factor in this as well and perhaps a different antihypertensive medication could be considered or it could be discontinued altogether. Furthermore with her recurrent chest pains she should seek an opinion from her primary care physician regarding this and I have counseled her to do so.  
 
I will see Mrs. Lindsay in follow up in 6 months time but I am available to discuss her care at any time in the interim.   
Sincerely,

Uecker, Vastie

MR# 3038560

Date of Admission: 3/30/36

Attending: Dr. Zehr

Admitting Resident: Patricia Nunn

Source of history:  records and pt



ID/CC:	62 yo F w/ hx of bronchiectasis s/p lobectomy, chronic MAC, HTN, fibromyalgia, and raynaud   s presented to OSH w/ chest pain, transferred to PCH w/NSTEMI and DVTs.



HPI: Pt at baseline occasionally gets SOB from her bronchiectasis if she has not had chest PT recently but otherwise is able to walk up multiple flights of stairs without SOB.  She has no known cardiac hx but does have HTN and + fam hx of early CAD.  Pt awoke this morning in her USOH but quickly had sudden onset of 10/10 sharp SSCP radiating to her right arm associated w/ right arm numbness.  Pain is slightly better w/ sitting up though pt denies pleuritic quality.  She then had a vasovagal attack, which she has had before in the setting of pain, and she started to feel lightheaded, nauseated, and diaphoretic.  She laid down on the floor and elevated her legs above her head which helped a little.  Her husband gave her Excedrin w/o improvement and called 911.  EMS gave her 3 puffs of NTG and 4 baby ASA w/o effect.  The ambulance brought her to the closest hospital, Colorow.  In the ED, she was found to be hypertensive w/ SBP 180s, for which she was started on TNG gtt.  She also underwent PE CT which per report was neg for PE but showed bilat DVTs, and she was started on heparin.  She was given fioricet, zofran, and fentanyl for her CP w/ relief.  She was then given a dose of IV lopressor and also had one episode of N/V.  Her labs were significant for + cardiac markers: 1st set w/ CK/MB/index 39/0.9/2.3, trop I 0.03, 2nd 443/57.3/12.9, trop 2.22, 3rd set 686/87.3/12.7, trop 4.18.  EKGs showed right-bundle morphology (though QRS not wide) w/ initial TWI V1-V3 which progressed to deepening TWI V1-V4 and some downsloping STD V3-V4.  Pt is currently chest pain free, no SOB, no palpitations.  She denies any preceding viral illness or any surprises or acute stressors in her life, though she has many chronic medical problems.

PE CT (reviewed w/ ED rads here): no PE to the level of subsegmental arteries, no dissection, no pericardial effusion or bowing of interventricular septum to suggest RV strain, lung parenchyma w/ scattered nodules, largest 6.5 mm, bilat fem veins w/ filling defects



EKG:  NSR 78 bpm, IVCD w/ right-bundle morphology unchanged w/ TWI V1-V2, flat Ts I, avL, 1 mm downsloping STD V3, < 1 mm horizontal STD V4



TTE: prelim read RV and LV function wnl, no segmental WMA



Impression:   62 yo F w/ hx of bronchiectasis s/p lobectomy, chronic MAC, HTN, fibromyalgia, and raynaud   s presented to OSH w/ chest pain, transferred to PCH w/ NSTEMI and DVTs, now chest pain free.  Possible etiologies for her chest pain w/ + cardiac markers include ACS, PE, myopericarditis, spasm, or apical ballooning syndrome.  Dissection less likely w/ equal pulses and not seen on PE CT.  Her EKG changes suggest an element of RV strain, though this is not borne out on TTE, and review of her OSH CT w/ radiology here did not reveal PEs (at least to the level of subsegmental arteries).  Her TTE did not show WMA, and her story could be c/w ACS or c/w myopericarditis or apical ballooning syndrome (esp w/ hx of fibromyalgia, raynaud   s, migraines, etc), though w/ + cardiac enzymes and dynamic EKG changes, need to have low threshold to cath if develops pain.

CC:   chest pain

HPI:
53 y/o female with PMHx significant for CHF/diastolic dysfunction, HTN who presents with 2 day history of chest pain.  Pain started yesterday AM while she was getting into her car and lasted a few minutes.  She had another episode later that day while trying to climb a step ladder in her kitchen and another episode in the ER today.  Each episode went away after few minute (during 3rd episode she got some NTG with relief of pain).  The pain feels like a pressure. She did have some diaphoresis with each episode and on the last episode also developed some nausea.  Inspiration makes the pain worse as well as sitting upright.  Denies palpitations.  Does have SOB with pain.  No recent illness. Did have URI few weeks ago.  Her activity is limited by arthritis in her knee, but she denies any CP with activity.

	Reason for visit:
   chest pain


	Interval History:
   71 yo male with HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, CAD/CABG September 2092 which was c/b premature graft failure of the SVG to LAD presents with increasing frequency of left jaw pain and chest pain for the past 4 wks. 

After his CABG, he underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD in 1/93 due to recurrent angina.  He then underwent May 94 and cath demonstrated severe native disease with a mid-LAD lesion which was treated with PTCA/Taxus stent. He had symptomatic relief until 11/94 when he began to experience exertional discomfort and dyspnea which has now progressed to symptoms at rest despite an aggressive medical regimen. He then underwent repeat cath in 12/94 which revealed in stent restenosis of prior LAD stent and was stented with a 2.25 x 13 mm Cypher stent. 

He reports complete symptomatic relief after his stent in 12/94 and he was chest pain free until about a month ago when he noted left-sided chest pain and left jaw pain that was similar to his cardiac chest pain in the past.  The pain was both exertional and non-exertional.  He also noted gradually worsening exertional dyspnea as well, though he has mostly been sedentary.  He denies any orthopnea, PND, leg edema or palpitations.  He has been compliant with all medications, including ASA and Plavix.  He is currently chest pain free.

Neurology ED Consult Note



Patient: Klein, Michelle

MRN:	2474410

Date: 	2/6/50

Time: 	10:00 p.m.

PCP:	Whitney Keller, M.D.



Reason for consult: garbled speech



HPI:   Patient is a 74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD stent (2144) who was in her USOH until this afternoon at 12:15 p.m. when she experienced sudden onset of garbled speech and difficulty ""expressing myself"" while cooking lunch for she and her husband.  This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull, L fronto-temporal headache that persisted for several hours.  She states she did not have word-finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself.   The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1-2 hours before she resolved back to baseline.  In addition to headache, associated symptoms included generalized weakness, feeling cold and mildly nauseated.  She denied visual changes, chest pain, sob, palpitations, lightheadedness, vertigo, difficulty with swallowing, coordination or gait.  She describes having a glass of orange juice with the thought that her sugar might be low, without apparent effect.



She recalls one similar episode ~ 2 years ago at which time she had her husband drive her home and she went to bed.  The speech difficulty had resolved by morning, and she apparently never told her physician or had any further work-up.  She has no known history of seizures.  Migraines occur 1-2x/year, preceeded by scintillating scotoma, associated with nausea, photophobia, relieved by sleep.  No recent fevers, chills,  weight loss or weight gain, cough, abd pain, diarrhea.  Reports regular exercise including this morning (stationary bicycle).

MICROBIOLOGY:



Nil current.




RADIOLOGY:



6/25/64 CT ABDO:

There is mild to moderate stenosis of the origins of the celiac and 

     SMA.  The IMA is occluded.  There is a moderate stenosis of the right 

     renal artery origin.  There are two left renal arteries.  The upper 

     renal artery is an accessory muscle and has a mild to moderate 

     stenosis at its origin.  The left renal artery has a high-grade 

     stenosis at its origin.  There is a circumaortic left renal vein.

      

     There is a chronic penetrating ulcer with focal aortic dissection of 

     the visceral segment of the abdominal aorta.  There is a moderate 

     stenosis of the left common iliac artery origin.

      

     The kidneys are unremarkable.

      

     The liver, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. 

     There is no intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal adenopathy.

      

     There is cholelithiasis.  The common bile duct is 2.1 cm in diameter 

     with a probable common duct stone.

      

     There are no bony lytic or blastic lesions.

      

     The visualized lungs are clear. There is centrilobular emphysema, 

     mild.  There are no pleural effusions.

      

     

     IMPRESSION:

      

     1.  Cholelithiasis with a dilated common bile duct and a common duct 

     stone.

      

     2.  No significant mesenteric arterial compromise.  The IMA is 

     occluded.

      

     3.  Stenosis of both left renal arteries, with the larger left renal 

     artery severely stenotic.

      

     4.  Mild to moderate stenosis of the right renal artery.

      

     5.  Chronic penetrating ulcer with focal dissection of the distal 

     segment of the abdominal aorta.

      


5/30/63 CAROTID US:

IMPRESSION


1. Bilateral moderate 50-69% stenosis of the internal carotid arteries.


2. &lt; 50% stenosis noted in the distal left common carotid artery.


3. No significant stenosis in the left external carotid artery.


4. Probable hemodynamically significant stenosis in the right external carotid

  artery.


4. Antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.


5. Normal flow in both subclavian arteries.




PREVIOUS ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATIONS:



Per the patient and his sons he was evalueated &gt;10 yrs ago w/ a colonoscopy which noted a single small benign polyp.



ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN:




87M h/o CAD (3vd), PVD, DM, HTN moderate b/l carotid stenosis, chronic ulcer in the distal ulcer w/ dissection, w/ a dilated CBD and choledocholithiasis for which we are consulted.



We will plan for further evaluation of the patient&#8217;s biliary system with an ERCP. 
Given the location of the largest stone i.e. not impacted with very slight LFT derangement I am concerned for alternative sources of the patient&#8217;s biliary dilation (e.g. pancreatic ca).



I have spoke to the patient and his 2 sons that given his numerous comorbidities in particular his cardiac status and carotid disease that he is at higher risk for complications which they all appreciate.






Recommendations:



-cont cipro/flagyl, if any concerns for decompsenation would add ampicillin also

-IVF

-clear liquids ok until midnight

-NPO from midnight

-neurology consult for risk of GA given carotid artery disease burden

-please confirm with vascular surg ERCP/GA safe given dissection/aortic ulcer present

-patient waitlisted for ERCP w/ GA on 6/27/64

                     CAMPBELL EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT

 

VALDEZ,HARLAN,JR.   845-41-54-4                VISIT DATE: 03/14/08

The patient was seen and examined in the emergency department.  The 

patient was seen by the Emergency Medicine resident.  I have 

discussed the management with the resident.  I have also seen the 

patient primarily and reviewed the medical record.  This is a brief 

addendum to the medical record.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Briefly, this is a 45-year-old 

male who complains of several days of nausea, vomiting, and left 

lower quadrant discomfort.  He also describes intermittent chest 

pain, which he has had for a number of months without significant 

change.  He was sent in from his primary care doctor today with 

this pain and was also noted to have some EKG changes.  The patient 

has no chest pain at the time of evaluation in the emergency 

department and no shortness of breath.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As indicated and otherwise negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As indicated in the chart.

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As indicated in the chart.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient is very 

well-appearing, a smiling, very pleasant gentleman in no acute 

distress.  The blood pressure is 119/90, the pulse 82, and the 

temperature 97.9 degrees.  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  The chest 

is clear to auscultation.  The heart has a regular rate and rhythm. 

The abdomen is soft.  He has left lower quadrant tenderness.  He 

also, of note on cardiovascular examination, has a soft murmur 

which he says he has had since childhood.  The extremities are 

normal.  The neurologic examination is non-focal. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  This is a gentleman with abdominal 

pain who will receive a CAT scan to rule out diverticulitis.  He 

has also had some non-specific ST changes on his EKG.  He is 

pain-free at this time.  He does not describe a classic exertional 

pattern for his chest pain, but given that he is a diabetic and 

with EKG changes, he will also be admitted for rule out MI.  A CT 

is pending at the time of this dictation.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  As above.  The 

patient's condition is currently stable.

CT abdomen Pelvis-  5/18/02   
 
IMPRESSION:           1. Urothelial thickening involving renal pelvises, ureters, and     bladder. Findings consistent with infection versus less likely     inflammation.     2. Bladder calculus.     3. Abdominal lymphadenopathy, increased since prior study, may be     consistent with progression of known sarcoid, versus malignancy.     4. Adrenal nodules, unchanged.
 
CT Chest 3/16
 
IMPRESSION:     1. Mediastinal, bilateral hilar, supraclavicular,     retroperitoneal, and gastrohepatic adenopathy likely represents     lymphoma rather than sarcoidosis given the patient age and     abdominal involvement.     2. Bilateral adrenal nodules.
 
Path: 04/10/2102 PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:A. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED ""4R LYMPH NODES, BIOPSY"" (including FSA):     Lymph node with non-necrotizing granulomata (see NOTE).B. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED ""4R LYMPH NODES, BIOPSY"":     Lymph node with non-necrotizing granulomata (see NOTE).


Impression:  Mrs. Haynes is a pleasant 67 yo female with biopsy demonstrating non-caesating granululoma in a left eye nodule and mediastinal lymph nodes.  Cx data was not obtained.  However, hx is not suggestive of past tuberculosis risk factors.  Clinical picture very suggestive of systemic sarcoidosis.  At this time she does not have an absolute indication for sarcoid treatment but she may benefit symptomatically from low dose steroids.  At this time she is reluctant to start steroids without discussing it with her family and Dr. Villalpando.


Recommendations:  
 
-Would consider Cardiac MRI given her hx of palpitations as cardiac sarcoid is an absolute indication for treatment.
-Would recommend checking PPD
-Would recommend starting prednisone 30mg po qday.  Will discuss this further with patient and family tomorrow.  There is no rush for treatment at this time and we could waite until Dr. Villalpando is available to speak with Mrs. Haynes.
-Would also recommend Bactrim prophylaxis while she is on greater than 15 mg Po prednisone.  1 DS M/W/F.
-Will follow.




Thank you for this interesting consult. Please call with questions.
 
Patient seen examine and case discussed with Dr. Layton.

Ulises Lopez, M.D.

Mount Ascutney Hospital



RE:  Danny Nielson

MAH#:  



Dear Dr. Lopez:



Thanks very much for referring Mr. Nielson to see me for evaluation of his lymphadenopathy.  I will review his history for you.  Mr. Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman who states that approximately three months ago, he had some increased swelling of his left leg.  About three to four weeks ago, this became increasingly evident and the patient was evaluated at Elders Home in Brandon, Indiana.  At that point, a CT scan was performed.  CT scan of the abdomen revealed significant adenopathy in the retroperitoneal space with a 2.0 cm node between the IVC in aorta and a 1.5 cm node just posterior to that, also a 1.0 cm retrocrural node was seen.  CT scan of the pelvis performed on the same day revealed a chain of retrocrural nodes in front of the aorta and vena cava extending to about 2.0 to 3.0 cm below the bifurcation as well as bulky adenopathy in the external iliac chain with an iliac mass measuring 3.0 to 3.5 cm in diameter on the left side.  The largest node in the inguinal area measures approximately 6.0 cm in diameter.  The patient was then seen by Dr. Lopez on April 12th who noted firm edema in the left leg and referred him to me for evaluation.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  



Wegener s granulomatosis initially diagnosed in 2083.  The patient says at that point he came to the Hilton Head Medical Center with severe photophobia and was diagnosed with scleritis.  This recurred in 2093.  He has been treated intermittently with low-dose azathioprine and steroids.  He is currently on a minimal dose of steroids.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  



The patient denies fevers or night sweats.  Does report 30 to 40-pound weight loss over the last year.  Reports increasing fatigue for the last year.  Denies heat or cold intolerance.  Reports his vision has been progressively worse, especially his near vision over the last six to eight months.  His hearing is quite poor especially in his left ear, however has not changed recently.  Has had no effect of sense of smell for the last many years.  Denies trouble chewing or swallowing but does gag when he drinks water intermittently. Denies wheezing.  Does report an intermittent dry cough secondary to nasal drip for the last two weeks.  Reports a runny nose for the last two weeks.  Increase in shortness of breath over the last month.  No muscle pain or muscle aches.  Denies chest pain.  Does report a sensation of burning pressure over his chest lasting approximately 4 to 5 minutes at a time, with exertion, this happens at least once a week, sometimes twice a week, it resolves quickly when he rests.  Denies palpitations.  Does report that he has been bruising more easily over the last several months.  No abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.  Intermittent constipation.  No diarrhea.  No weakness, numbness or changes in his mood or affect.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  



The patient lives at home in Bisbee, Indiana with his wife.  His wife is wheelchair bound and he is her sole caregiver.  He has four sons and two daughters.  He has grandchildren, four boys and four girls.  The patient was the long time Chief of Security for Cisco.  This job is currently held by his son.  He smoked about a pack a day from age 14 to age 50 quitting about 26 years ago.  Did drink significantly in the past, but usually only on the weekends, but did not drink everyday.



FAMILY HISTORY:  



The patient s father had colon cancer, which was apparently cured and died at age 87 of old age.  The patient s mother had breast cancer, which was cured and died at age 89 of old age.  The patient s brother had some sort of new cancer in his armpit; the exact histology is unknown.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  



Weight of 268 pounds, temperature of 97.5, blood pressure of 140/82, pulse of 84 and respiratory rate of 20.  General:  A well-appearing, well-developed gentleman in no apparent distress accompanied by his son today.  Head is normocephalic and atraumatic, thinning head of grey hair.  Pupils are equal round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Oropharynx is moist.  No mucositis, pharyngitis, thrush or increased lymphoid tissue is seen.  The patient has a scar in the inside of his left buccal mucosa.  He has numerous actinic keratoses over his scalp and behind his left ear.  Otherwise, skin reveals no jaundice, rash or suspicious lesions.  Tongue is midline and well papillated.  The patient has a hearing aid in his right ear.  Neck is supple and somewhat full.  No jugular venous distention or thyromegaly is visible.  Lungs:  Slightly decreased breath sounds throughout and clear to auscultation.  No wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  Back:  No costovertebral angle or vertebral body tenderness.  There is a very old healed scar in the left posterior flank consistent with prior nephrectomy.  Heart:  Soft systolic ejection murmur, no gallops or rubs, intermittent skipped beats, otherwise regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 normal.  Abdomen is obese, soft, nontender and nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly is palpable.  Extremities:  2+ edema on the right and 3+ on the left, pitting.  Lymph node exam:  No anterior or posterior auricular, no anterior or posterior cervical, no submandibular, submental, infraclavicular or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.  The patient has a 1.0 cm lymph node deep in the right axilla.  No epitrochlear lymphadenopathy.  Inguinal region:  A 4.0 to 5.0 cm left inguinal lymph node mass is palpated.  Neurologic exam:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact to specific examination.  Strength 5-/5, bilateral grip, bicep, triceps, deltoids, knee flexion and extension.  Sensory exam intact to light touch bilateral upper extremities and decreased sensation to light touch in the left lower extremity.



LABORATORY STUDIES:  



Recent laboratory values from April 12th reveals a creatinine of 1.5, glucose of 244 and calcium of 11.  Liver function tests are within normal limits.  Hemoglobin A1c is 6.  White count of 5.2, hematocrit of 33.9 with an MCV of 81 and a platelet count of 155,000.



IMAGING STUDIES:  



The patient has a PET/CT scan which was performed this morning and has not been read.  To my initial evaluation, there is notable PET avid lymphadenopathy both in the retroperitoneal space as well as in the left inguinal region.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



1.  Mr. Danny Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman with notable lymphadenopathy both by report from the outside hospital as well as by my initial evaluation of his CT scan from Mount Ascutney Hospital.  This is very likely to be consistent with lymphoma.  I discussed lymphoma in general terms with the patient and his son.  I informed them that many lymphomas were treatable and some of them would indeed be curable.  This would all depend on the exact histology that was revealed by biopsy.  These sites of biopsy would be the left inguinal region.  I informed them that the treatments that would be considered would include either antibodies, chemotherapy or radiation and these would depend significantly on the type of lymphoma that was found.  The fact that there are no B symptoms and that he feels relatively well might indicate that this is a low-grade lymphoma.  However, the relatively rapid onset of his leg swelling in the left leg may be more consistent with a higher-grade process.  I feel that his left-sided edema is very likely due to decreased lymphatic drainage from the left leg.  However, further discussion of his lymphoma will have to wait final pathology.  I introduced the patient to Dr. Victor Ashley who is scheduled to perform a core needle lymph node biopsy later this afternoon.

2.  Cardiovascular:  I am very concerned about the patient s history of intermittent burning chest pressure.  If he will be diagnosed with an aggressive lymphoma and will need anthracycline, it would be important to have Cardiology on board.  He has a significant murmur and his symptoma are suggestive of angina.  The patient will be evaluated by Dr. Square Turk later this week.  In follow-up, Mr. Nielson will see me back in clinic next Sunday six days from now.  At that point, we should have a firm and final biopsy report in hand and the staging studies also have been completed.  At that point, we will be able to discuss therapy in a meaningful way.  The patient will call me back if problems arise in the meantime.



Sincerely,







Gene Quadri, M.D.

                                              9-14-88
 
 
 
HPI:  Ms. Youngman is a 31 year old woman with a history of morbid obesity, 
complicated by diabetes, who was a former patient of Dr. Xitlali Crane.  
She comes in today for routine follow-up.  Patient's diabetes was 
initially diagnosed during gestation with her daughter.  Patient was 
formerly controlled by insulin but has lost 61 pounds over the last 16 
months and is now off all medications and states her finger sticks have 
been excellent with a peak of about 150, with most well below that.  
Patient also has a history of        in situ which was treated with laser 
treatment to the cervix.  She is a hemophiliac carrier.  Has a history of 
migraines and currently is being treated by Dr. Jacoby for depression.  
Since her last visit with Dr. Crane, patient apparently attempted suicide 
in July.  It is unclear how serious the attempt was although she did cut 
her left upper extremity.  Since then she states that she has been feeling 
a lot better and feels that she has really made progress with Dr. Jacoby.  
Her mood seems fine today in clinic.  Patient denies any medical symptoms 
at this time.
 
Patient's cardiac risk factors include smoking 5-6 cigarettes a day.  A 
positive family history of coronary artery disease including a mother who 
just died of a heart attack in May at age 53 and had had a previous MI at 
age 40 and a CABG at age 43.  Patient does not have hypercholesterolemia 
or hypertension but does have the diabetes history as noted above.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Notable for tobacco use as noted above and she drinks 
about one beer per day when she is distraught that she continues to do.  
She says that she should not be drinking with her medications.
 
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Moderately obese Hispanic woman in no acute distress.  
Blood pressure: 120/70.  HEENT: unremarkable.  Neck: no JVD, carotids were 
2+ bilaterally without bruits.  Chest: clear.  Cardiac: within normal 
limits.  Abdomen: benign.  Extremities: without edema.
 
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
1.   Weight control:  Patient has had excellent weight loss over the last 
     16 months.  I told her how impressed I was with this.  She, in fact, 
     does not require any oral hypoglycemics for good sugar control at 
     this time.  I will let her continue this dietary control for the next 
     six months and check her hemoglobin A1C at that time to assess her 
     control.  However, in the past, she has been very straight forward 
     with Dr. Crane according to her notes.
2.   Depression:  Patient continues to be actively depressed.  Is 
     currently on trazodone, Klonopin, Paxil and Motrin.  She will 
     continue to follow-up with Dr. Jacoby with whom she seems to be very 
     happy.

                                              9-14-88
 
 
 
3.   General health care:  Patient will need a pelvic exam in six months 
     time.  Patient currently has an intrauterine device which was placed 
     in June.  She does not take oral contraceptives because of her 
     history of diabetes and history of heart disease.  She was instructed 
     that she should go to Gynecological Clinic if any symptoms related to 
     the IUD occur.
4.   Diabetes:  Patient's blood sugars have had peaks of about 150 as 
     mentioned above.  I will check her hemoglobin A1C in six months time.  
     Patient feels good with no polydipsia, no urinary frequency and no 
     headache.  I elected, therefore, not to treat it at this time.  
     Patient was given prescriptions for fingersticks and lancets.

RADIOLOGY/STUDIES:

     1.  Scattered punctate foci of DWI hyperintensity that are not

     well evaluated on ADC or exponential images, in the right MCA/PCA

     border zone distribution.  Given the pattern of signal

     abnormality, these most likely represent subacute infarcts, with

     possible subacute on chronic right posterior corona radiata

     infarct.

     

     2.  Evidence of prior right MCA territory infarct and chronic

     small vessel ischemic disease.

     

     3.  No hemodynamically significant stenosis of the extracranial or

     intracranial circulation.



ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN

75 yo woman with a history of stroke, HTN who presents with L arm numbness. While her deficits appear to have resolved, arguing against stroke, she clearly has multiple punctate foci of DWI hyperintensity that would be consistent with acute stroke. These strokes are in the PCA region and at the watershed region of the MCA/PCA and so could represent both anterior and posterior circulation emboli. Given that her carotid arteries are relatively clear, her heart or arch may be possible sources of embolus.

- Has had stroke workup in the past that has been unrevealing

- Would benefit from a repeat echocardiogram to assess for any new vegetations or thrombi

- Would also benefit from repeat Holter to assess for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation

- Admit to Internal Medicine service

Frederick Q. Valladares, M.D.

Medical Director

January 27, 2089



Medical Record Number:  8751045  Francisco, Xue



Procedure:  The patient is a 56-year-old Spanish-speaking female scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Surgery is scheduled on January 28, 2089 by Dr. Xavier Israel kenneth Xenos.



Chief Complaint & Present Illness:  Patient briefly evaluated on 12/30/88 as part of preoperative evaluation for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy then scheduled for 12/31/88.  Over the past year patient has had difficulty with right upper quadrant pain as well as epigastric pain.  These episodes tend to happen more frequently after she has had a rich meal.  Other symptoms that occurred include nausea and vomiting.  Patient denies jaundice.  Today, patient states that she still has some abdominal tenderness greatest at the right costal margin and radiating into right flank.



At the time of evaluation on 12/30/88 patients had symptoms of URI and LRI.  She reported back/green sputum, mild shortness of breath and increased use of her grandson's inhaler.  After consultation with Dr. Valladares it was decided that patient should be evaluated by her primary care provider for further treatment of her respiratory tract infection and then follow-up with surgeon to reschedule her surgery.  Patient reports that she went to University Hospital and there they treated her with antibiotics and inhaler.  Unfortunately patient is unable to recall the name of the antibiotic or the inhaler.  Currently she denies any symptoms of sputum production, cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.  Also denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.



Patient does have a history of coronary artery disease.  She is status post an MI 11/82.  Patient had cardiac catheterization at OSH 12/3/82 that reportedly showed a critical mid right lesion and a mild left main and left anterior descending lesion.  12/09/82 patient underwent cardiac catheterization at PVH and a PTCA was done.  Patient did well until 10/83 when she was admitted to PVH with symptoms of chest tenderness, left arm pain, tachycardia, palpitations, diaphoresis, dry mouth, shortness of breath, dizziness, and darkening of revision.  Patient did rule out for MI by serial enzymes and there are no changes seen on her ECG.  Patient denies any difficulty with chest pain or left arm pain since that time.  She has had episodes of shortness of breath with exertion however, these seem more related to her respiratory status rather than her cardiac disease.



Stress test done 1/26 showed a normal exercise capacity (METS=7), ECG nondiagnostic for ischemia and the perfusion images were suggestive of anterior ischemia although body habitus limited the interpretation.







Past Medical History:  Significant medical problems include:  

1.  Hypertension

2.  CAD, status post MI 2082, status post PTCA 2082

3.  Asthma (no hospitalizations or intubations)

1.  Status post cardiac catheterization and PTCA, 9/82  

2.  Status post D&C secondary to prolonged menstrual bleeding

3.  Status post tubal ligation

ASA Physical Status II

56-year-old female with a history of CAD, SLE, hypertension, arthritis, asthma and chronic low back pain presents for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Patient originally scheduled for surgery on 12/31/88 however because of LRI surgery was postponed.  Patient much improved, lungs clear, no wheezing, no shortness of breath.  It has only been three-week since her infection and therefore increased airway reactivity may be an issue.  Dr. Hoffman explained this to patient.  Dr. Hoffman also reviewed with patient medications to take prior to surgery 1/28/89.  Currently, patient denies any symptoms of cardiac ischemia.  Does have chronic chest pain/tenderness which is reproducible by palpation.  Patient states that this is not her ""cardiac pain"".

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Workman in follow-up today. 
Overall he is relatively stable from a cardiac standpoint.  Most
importantly, recently he was laid off from his job at Belkin.  He
has been quite depressed about this.  
 
His medical regimen includes Cyclosporin 150 b.i.d., prednisone 6
q.d., Imuran 275 q.d., Cardizem CD 300 q.d., Cardura 4 mg. q.d.,
Pravachol 40 mg. q.d., Axid 150 b.i.d., Calcium, vitamin C and D,
Mag. Oxide 250 q.d., Paxil 300 q.d., NPH Insulin.
 
On physical examination he was well appearing in no distress.  He
had a blood pressure of 136/80 with a heart rate of 90, weight was
309 pounds which has increased eight pounds from July.  Chest was
clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam revealed a flat JVP at 30
degrees, non-displaced PMI with a normal S1 and S2 without murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.
Abdomen was soft, nontender. There is no organomegaly, no
hepatojugular reflux. Extremities without edema.
 
Electrocardiogram reveals normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 90. 
Intervals of .16/.08/.33 with an axis of 70 degrees. This is a
normal tracing and unchanged from his previous tracing on 9/20/86.Edwin Workman
#612-48-04-0                  - 2 -          November 09, 2086
 
Therefore, Mr. Workman is stable at this time from a cardiac
perspective.  We will make the necessary adjustments in his medical
regimen according to his laboratory results.
 
Best regards.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
 
Elmer Knott, M.D.

FOLLOW-UP VISIT: CAD, DM, HTN



HPI:  The pt is a 71 yo female here for follow-up visit for DM monitoring, lipid management, htn.  She was hospitalized for acute MI last December and is being followed by cardiology.  Since her last follow-up the patient has had no episodes of exertional or rest chest pain, no DOE or SOB.  She was visiting her relatives in Oregon this month and did have one episode of SVT in setting of viral URI.  Experienced sudden onset of palpitations with discomfort, lasted 30 minutes without chest pain, lightheadedness or diaphoresis and then resolved spontaneously.  She has had no further episodes.  She has been compliant with her medications over the last few months and has not experienced any side effects; however, when asked directly, has had 2 or 3 episodes of lightheadedness in morning with abrupt position changes, nothing long-lasting and no near syncope.

     Pt reports blood sugars by finger stick at home of 100-140s generally.  Has had good control by her accounts over last few months.  Was unaware of results of May blood draw with increase in HA1C of 8.0.

abd: soft NT ND with normal BS

ext: normal pulses, no edema



Labs:  last hemoglobin A1C in 5/77 of 8.0, gluc 192, LDL 115, TG 71, HDL 36



A/P:  71 yo female with DM, HTN, and heart disease with slightly worsening glycemic and lipid control when tested 2 months ago, perhaps related to modest weight gain of 10 lbs.

     1. DM - pt with rising A1C despite good FS at home.  Given pt feels control has improved since last visit, will stall on changing micronase until next visit at one month.  Pt to have repeat a1c at that point, and if still high, will double micronase.  Good bp control on zestril.  Had microalb this year.  Still awaiting visit to ophthal - gave pt another referral.

     2. CAD - pt with LDL of 115 when previously well controlled on this dose of zocor.  After negotiation with patient, have agreed to wait to raise dose until next visit as well.  Would benefit from 30 mg tab.  Otherwise TG look good.  Pt with episode of SVT in setting of viral illness.  BP and pulse will tolerate small increment in b-blocker.  Given known CAD without intervention, impt to control SVTs.  Increase atenolol to 100 mg QD, keep zestril at current dose.

     3. HM - pt refuses mammogram.  She continues to be suspicious that screening tests are experimental and given her age ""wouldn't change anything.""  Discussed baseline bone density test, and she has agreed to consider this.  Refused colonscopy at this point.

November 20, 2093  Endocrine/Diabetes

Present Illness:  
Asked to see this 59 year old man with IPF, diagnosed in 2090, an admission to BCC last month with pneumonia, who presented with rapidly progressive respiratory distress last week and was admitted intubated to the MICU. He as treated with high dose Solumedrol and with antibiotics, and is improving nicely. He is extubated and has begun to eat. 

Diabetes was diagnosed 14 years ago. He was treated with pioglitazone 45 mg qd, metformin 2000 mg in divided doses and a sulfonylurea until February of this year, when the sulfonylurea was replaced with insulin. For convenience with his travel schedule, his insulin has been 70/30 administered by pen, with 30 U before breakfast and 40 U before  supper. He tests his BS before  breakfast and supper only and reports that, since he has been more careful with his diet recently, they have been in the low 100   s and mid 100   s, respectively. His hemoglobin A1c was 7.4 % a month ago.
Retinopathy:	He is due for his yearly appointment with his ophthalmologist. No retinopathy in the past.  
Nephropathy:	BUN/Cr 31/1.3 today. No microalbumin/creatinine ratio in CAS.
Neuropathy:	He has occasional paresthesias in his feet.
Cardiac:	He is s/p stent for coronary artery disease about 8-9 years ago.
Vascular:	No claudication.

His IPF is treated with Mucomyst and gamma interferon, which he administers to himself. 

Past Medical History:  
Surgery:	Coronary stent
	Lung biopsy at time of diagnosis of IPF 
Medical:	Hypertension	
	Hyperlipidemia
	GERD
Allergies:	No known drug allergies.
Smoking History:	No
Alcohol History:	No

Family History:  
There is a significant family history of diabetes, including his mother, maternal grandmother, one of his 5 siblings, and some paternal relatives as well.

Social History: 
Lives with his wife and their adopted son, who is a Recruitment Officer.
Computer and Network Technicians for General Dynamics, covering 8 states. His job entails travel.

Review of Systems: above
Ears: Mild hearing loss. 
Review of systems is otherwise negative.

Physical Exam:	
Very pleasant, ruddy complexioned man in no distress.
BP:   148/78		P:   76, regular	T: 98.0
Wt:   209 by history		Ht: 5    7.5    by history
HEENT:	Anicteric. Full EOM's. 
Fundi:	Not examined.
Carotids:	Normal pulses, without bruits
Thyroid:	Not palpable
Chest:	Few rales anteriorly, L>R.
Heart:	Normal S1; physiologic S2.  No gallops.  No murmurs
Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness. No palpable AAA. 
Extremities:	No edema.  DP 2+ R, absent L. PT 2+,=.  Good foot care.
Neurological:	AJ 1+,=, with normal relaxation. 

Impressions and Plan:	
59 year old man with type 2 diabetes now on steroids for IPF flare, currently down to 125 mg q12h, given at noon and MN.
Having reviewed his recent data, would suggest that we change his current insulin to:
NPH 40 / Regular 10+ scale qAM before  breakfast
Regular 10+ scale qPM before  supper
NPH 30 at bedtime
QID Regular sliding scale
These initial doses will need to be adjusted based on experience and on any changes in the steroid doses.
I have no objection to resuming his pioglitazone, or substituting rosiglitazone while he is here, as long as you do not feel that volume overload is playing any role in his deterioration.
I would prefer not to resume the metformin while is at risk for acute respiratory deterioration with risk of acidosis.
Would change the steroid dosing to 8AM, 8 PM, hoping that we can also start to reduce the doses, PM first, if possible.
He appears to have an anemia that has at least a component of iron deficiency. If you agree, would start iron repletion. (Note that in addition to the iron studies, his MCV, though still normal, has come down over time.)

Thanks.

Team 4 admission note


Admission Date/Time: June 26, 2152 at 7:30PM
Patient Name: Yasseen Jacks
MRN#: 8841350
Attending: Uriel Mays MD
Code status: DNR/DNI per discussion with son
Historian: medical record, patient's son Ursula Jacks


Chief Complaint: agitation


HPI: 
Mr. Jacks is an Indonesian-speaking 85M with a history of dementia, lung nodule, CHF who presents with progressively worsening agitation at home.  As patient is currently very somnolent this history is based on phone interview with Ursula Jacks who is the HCP and is very involved with his father's care.  The patient was diagnosed with dementia by his PCP about 3 years ago and has been relatively stable living at home (on 2nd floor) in Keystone Heights with his wife who has been his primary caretaker; their two sons are very involved as well.  Over the last 6 months they have noticed increasing confusion, agitation, and labile emotions.  They noted he has been confused about location, time (recalls distant past but not recent past), and has occasionally not been able to identify his wife.  He has become emotionally labile and sometimes agitated.  His son notes that he recently had to physically force him to sit down and take his medications.  His wife has had to stay up at night to watch the patient to make sure he did not wander.  They are particularly worried about his ability to take the flight of stairs to their home since it takes him about 15 min to get up and appears unsteady. About 1 wk ago, while his wife was out of their home, he wandered out and locked himself out; when she returned he angrily accused her of locking him out.  Their mother has had increasing difficulty caring for him and has called the 2 sons for help daily for the past week.  They called his PCP about these accelerating changes and he was started on lorazepam 0.5-1mg Q4h prn which brought mild improvement.  Out of concern for his father's and mother's safety they brought him to the ED for evaluation and placement which their PCP has already begun to discuss with them.


They have not noticed fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea/constipation (on aggressive regimen), complaints of pain, vision changes.  They have noticed recent urinary incontinence in the last few days.  


In the ED:  VS were T: 98.2    P: 71    BP: 169/84    RR: 18    SaO2: 93% RA.  Exam was notable only for rales bilaterally and mild-moderate agitation. CXR was normal. CBC was at baseline.  UA pending. CT brain could not be performed due to agitation.  They spoke to his PCP who felt this was all due to progression of his dementia.  He was given ativan 2mg IV (total) and haldol 5mg IV (total).  Also got labetalol PO 200mg PO x 1.  




Past Medical History: 


Diabetes mellitus (adult onset): diet-controlled. 

Hyperlipidemia

Thyroid nodule: stable for years, on methimazole

Anemia

Benign essential hypertension

Congestive heart failure

Dementia

Lung Nodule: increase in size of lung nodule when CT repeated in Feb (suspicious for BAC) Son Ursula spoke to Dr. Daniel (per son's report) and they discussed observing and not being aggressive with surgery etc as even though it could be cancer, an invasive operation, considering his multiple other problems, could be much worse for him than simple observation. They have an appt with Dr. Daniel in September.

(908) 649-3317



CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Follow-up laboratory testing.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old white

man who I have not seen since November of 2088.  Approximately

four weeks ago, he started noting visual changes.  He saw colored

spots floating in his visual field.  He has been noting some

decreased depth perception and visual acuity.  At the same time,

he has been getting throbbing unilateral headaches, which he

believes were migraines.  He saw an ophthalmologist at Mediquik who told him that his eye exam was within normal limits.

 He was then referred to Dr. Gill for neurologic evaluation. 

Dr. Gill did not note any significant neurologic deficits. 

However, during his workup, he did check a hemoglobin A1c, which

came back at 10.2.  Of note, the last time I saw the patient, I

had sent him a letter stating that his glucose was slightly

elevated and asking him to return for a fasting glucose.  He

never returned for that testing.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,

obesity, and gout.



MEDICATIONS:  HCTZ 50 mg p.o. q.d.,  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.,

allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q.d.



ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.



FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for diabetes but positive for kidney

failure.  This is thought to be due to glomerulonephritis.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a Graphic Arts Technician in Oconto.  He is

currently on a leave of absence from work.  He is a nonsmoker.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He believes that he has lost some weight over

the past four weeks but cannot quantify the amount.  He has been

noting anxiety symptoms, increased urinary frequency, and

nocturia.  Otherwise, constitutional, HEENT, cardiac,

respiratory, GI, GU, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and

dermatologic are negative.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, he is a pleasant obese white

man in no acute distress.  Vitals: Blood pressure 134/90, pulse

66 and regular, and weight 249 pounds.  HEENT:  PERRL, EOMI,

anicteric sclerae.  Clear oropharynx with dry mucous membranes. 

Neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.  Chest: 

CTA&P bilaterally.  Heart: RRR, no MRG.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft,

NT/ND, NABS, no HSM.  Extremities:  No CCE.  Neuro:  A&O x 3, 2+

DTRs bilaterally.



LABORATORY DATA: EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 73 beats per

minute, normal axis and intervals, no ST-T-wave changes.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

1.   Diabetes.  The patient was advised that his laboratory

testing and symptoms are all consistent with adult-onset

diabetes.  Given the severity of his symptoms, I have elected to

start him on metformin 500 mg p.o. q.d.  Use and side effects

were reviewed.  He will have Chem-7, urinary microalbumin and

fasting lipid profile checked today.  Unfortunately, he was not

actually fasting.  He will also be referred to Gretchen Drew and

Bertha Ely for further diabetic and nutritional education. 

He will be started on lisinopril instead of  HCTZ.  He is asked

to return in six weeks for follow up of his blood pressure.  He

was advised that his visual changes are likely due to lens

swelling due to the uncontrolled diabetes.  I assume that this

will resolve as the blood sugars come under better control.  He

was given a written note regarding leave of absence from his job

until his symptoms clear.

2.  Migraines.  The patient does sound as if he is also having

migraines.  We will address this at future visits.

HPI:  This is a 71-year-old right-handed gentleman with past medical history significant for insulin-dependent diabetes, coronary artery disease, status post bypass surgery, hypertension, and bladder cancer, who presents with worsening neck and left arm pain, which is now interfering with his daily life.  The patient has had a chronic arthritic pain throughout his body, which he has been complaining of for approximately 10 years involving his 
neck, shoulder, arms, knees, and back.  More recently in the past months to couple of years, his neck, left arm, and shoulder pain have been his predominant pain symptoms.  It has been a gradual onset.  He has had similar problems in the past.  He reports that his pain is intermittent and occurs daily.  He states the pain is burning, cramping, pins and needle, sharp, numb, shooting pain, dull achy, electric- like, throbbing, and pressure-like.  The pain involves numbness to his hands and fingers on his left arm.  His pain ranges from 10/10 at worst to 0/10 at best.  It is worse in almost all active positions including lying down, standing, sitting, walking, and driving.  Medications do not seem to help.  Relaxation and rest decreases the pain.  It is also worsened by lifting or bending his neck.  He tried physical therapy approximately 10 days ago at Manamana with minimal to no relief.  The patient has had injections to his cervical spine in the past, he has had shoulder injections, which helped in the past.  He had MRI performed of his 
cervical spine on March 21, 2161, which documented moderate- to-severe degenerative changes throughout his cervical spine with significant right neuroforaminal narrowing at multiple levels.  There is narrowing of the left neural foramen at 
C5-6.  
 
PAST MEDICATIONS:  The patient is not clear what pain medicines he has taken in the past.  
 
Current medications include Nexium, Colace, atenolol, aspirin, Neurontin 200 mg two times a day, insulin, Pravachol, glucosamine chondroitin, vitamin E, Lasix, and potassium chloride.

inspection, no significant kyphoscoliosis.  Cervical range of motion is limited throughout.  Flexion 20 degrees, extension 10 degrees, rotation is 20 degrees, right and left.  The patient is unable to side bend significantly. Reflexes are 2+, bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis. Manual muscle testing is 5/5, bilateral upper extremities 
with the exception of wrist extension, shoulder abduction, and shoulder flexion and extension, and internal, external rotation.  Muscle tone is normal with the exception of asymmetry in the left hand interossei.  Sensory testing is impaired to pinprick, throughout bilateral upper extremities to the elbows.  Intact grossly to light touch per the patient's report.  Gait is steady with a cane.  The patient has signs of limited range of motion in the left shoulder, status post multiple surgeries and limited range of motion in all directions.  He has some palpation tenderness of the cervical spine, in C5-6 and C4-5 paravertebral areas on the left.   
Medical decision making involved review of the patient's radiology reports and radiology films.  
 
IMPRESSION:  The patient has a significant degenerative disease of his cervical spine.  In addition, he has multiple levels of neural foraminal narrowing and herniation in the cervical spine.  In addition to this, he has symptoms consistent with diabetic peripheral neuropathy with also prior traumatic injury to his shoulder with possible brachial plexopathy.  
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:  
1.  Given the multiple etiologies possible for his symptoms in his left arm, which are his predominant symptoms:  Brachial plexopathy versus peripheral neuropathy versus cervical radiculopathy, we have referred the patient for an EMG to delineate the cause of his symptoms.  
2.  He will return to clinic after his EMG and from that point, we will decide the course of action for pain management.  At this time, he will continue on the Neurontin 200 mg two times a day.  We will review his medications on next visit.  We provided the patient also with education in regards to his problems and the treatment options.

EDVISIT^51639357^NOONAN, FRANCE^07/25/85^ELROD, RYLEY

This patient was seen with Dr. Ussery.  I confirm that I have

interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's

documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old male with a

history of cough and pleuritic type chest pain.  The patient

denies any nausea or vomiting.  He does have history of MI as

well as multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease.  He

also reports lower extremities swelling worse than usual, and has

left greater than right edema at baseline due to a reconstructive

surgery following motor vehicle collision.  Of note, the

patient's medications include Coumadin, which he is on for atrial

fibrillation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake, alert, and in no

distress.  His vital signs show heart rate of 70, respiratory

rate of 24, blood pressure 112/72, and oxygen saturation 96% on

room air and 98% on 2 liters.  His lungs are clear and heart is

irregularly irregular.  This is somewhat limited due to body

habitus.  The abdomen is soft and there is a chronic left upper

quadrant tenderness.  The back shows left CVA tenderness.

LABORATORY DATA:  The laboratory analysis shows a hematocrit of

42.1 and a white blood cell count of 7.6.  Cardiac biomarkers are

negative, and the troponin is less than 0.1.  A d-dimer is less

than 200.  The INR is 1.7.  UA is pending.  ECG shows an atrial

fibrillation with some nonspecific T-wave changes in leads V3

through V6.

IMAGING STUDIES:  A chest radiograph was a markedly limited due

to patient's habitus.

DECISION MAKING AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  There was no

clear etiology to the patient's shortness of breath.  Given his

anticoagulation and a negative d-dimer, we feel that this is

unlikely to be PE.  It is clearly possible to be cardiac, given

the history of coronary artery disease and a slightly abnormal

electrocardiogram.  This may be pneumonia, and the chest x-ray is

not terribly helpful.  We are obtaining a CT scan of the chest

without IV contrast to better delineate the pulmonary

architecture, and are admitting the patient to the Medicine

Service for monitoring and cycling of enzymes and ECGs.

DIAGNOSES:

1.  Shortness of breath.

2.  T-wave inversions on electrocardiogram.

CC: dyspnea, hypoxia 



HPI: 

47 yo man with long-standing bronchiectasis requiring double lung transplant in 2073 who states that for approximately the last month he has felt occasionally dyspneic and &#8220;dizzy&#8221; (which he more specifically describes as a sensation of unsteadiness, not vertigo-like), along with several discrete episodes of nausea with vomiting (maybe three days in the last month, the last time yesterday). 
He was visiting friends/family near The Woodlands, when on 8/20 he awoke feeling acutely dyspneic and weak.



He presented to Marion Memorial Hospital, where he was noted to be saturating in the high 90s on 2L, which is his baseline (4L with activity). Other notable labs were a Cr of 2.3, BNP 84, INR subtherapeutic at 1.4. CXR was read as no acute processHe was thought to be wheezy, and was given 10 mg of dexamethasone IV, nebulizers. He was empirically started on a heparin drip (800 unit bolus, 1800 units/hr) given his h/o DVT and a subtherapeutic INR. He was then transferred to MARY. 



In the ED here his INR was 2.4 (and his PTT was over 150). Upon interview here, he endorses the above history. Vitals upon arrival to the ED 97.3 79 141/95 24 100%2L.



He also notes that his INR had been stable recently (followed by his PCP) on his current dose of 4 Coumadin daily (except 2 on Mon/Fri). 



He denies cough, chest pain, GI symptoms, URI symptoms



15-point ROS negative except as in HPI with following additions: none.

-check orthostatics

-continue heparin drip at reduced rate (units/hr), recheck INR this am, continue coumadin at home dose, lower extremity ultrasound to eval for DVT (as possible proxy for PE)

-continue rglan per home regimen

-transplant service to follow

-lung exam currently clear, little suspicion for COPD flare &#8211; will resume steroids at home dose (12.5 mg)

-schedule duonebs

-discussed with pulm &#8211; hold am dose of mycophenolate/tacro today, restart this evening

-continue prophylactic meds/abx: colistin, azithro, bactrim, doxy



Renal insufficiency: at baseline. Seems relatively euvolemic

-will continue colchicine for gout proph as this has been long-standing

-lasix still on hold

-BNP was low at OSH; don&#8217;t suspect volume overload



Chronic hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia:

-continue mag gluconate, substitute calcium carbonate for calcium citrate

ID/CC: presumed lung rejection s/p lung transplant


HPI: 
Mr. Albert is a 44-year-old man with bronchiectasis who underwent bilateral lung transplantation in July 2073. He was seen in the post-transplant clinic on 10/29/2079 with complaints of worsening dyspnea on exertion over the preceding two weeks to the point that he has been symptomatic with ADLs and after walking 4-5 steps. He says that his prednisone dose was decreased from 12.5 to 10 mg daily approximately 1 month ago and that his tacrolimus dose had been decreased earlier this year. At baseline, he is on supplemental oxygen (2L NC at rest and 4L NC with exertion). He denied F/C/cough/chest pain/jaw or L arm pain/sick contacts. Recently had a treadmill ETT and TTE in Florida. Also some morning headaches for the past 5 days. Denies vision change, sinus pain or drainage. No recent leg pain/swelling or prolonged travel. No recent travel outside of Fountain Of The Four Rivers area. Has a puppy at home; no other recent animal contact. No recent falls. His PFTs demonstrated a worsening FEV1 and CT scan demonstrates evidence of worsening obstruction, likely related to rejection. He is being admitted for treatment of acute on chronic rejection.


ROS:   negative in detail except as noted above.

HPI: 76 year old Spanish speaking male with numerous medical problems (IDDM, Afib, HTN, PVD, Cr baseline 1.7, no prior HF,, normal echo 2085, normal MIBI 2085) who was just dishcharged 28 days ago for LE edema admission, who complains of 3 weeks of sore throat. He states that because of this he has suffered from a gradual dyspnea, complicated by orthopnea and PND for two days.  He states he has left sided pleuritic chest pain worse with inspiration.  He states he also has noticed increased baseline LE edema for 2 weeks, but denies and increase in abdominal girth.  He states he decided to seek medical treatment for his gradual onset shortness of breath.


The patient states he has been taking all of his medications and has not increased the sodium in his diet recently.  He denies fever, chills, dysuria, asymettric leg swelling, or any palpable blood vessels in his legs.


Of note the patient is on 80 mg BID of lasix for his LE edema though his most recent echo, 2085, shows a normal EF and the patient has no history of CHF.

Billie Givens, M.D.

406 Cross Street

Juana Diaz, CT 89568 



Re:  	Horn, Gregory

      	BCC Unit #: 977-82-23



Dear Dr. Givens:



I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Horn, today in follow-up.  



VATS biopsy on 9/27 showed usual interstitial pneumonitis with extensive smooth muscle metaplasia - a rather unusual reading.  



Since the biopsy, he has recovered well, but is mildly more short of breath than previous. For example, he notes that going up the four stairs to the house with bundles he is mildly short of breath and has to rest.



The cough is slightly increased to 3/10, but is markedly better than on presentation.



He has no leg edema, chest pain, skin rash, joint problems, or fevers.



He has managed to lose 6 lbs. by giving up sweets, and his sugars are slightly better.  



GE reflux is very well controlled.



Medications:  Prilosec 20 mg b.i.d., aspirin, Glyset, Actose, metformin, metoprolol, Lipitor, and Hyzaar.



On Examination:  He is well appearing. Blood pressure 110/60, respiratory rate 20 and unlabored.  Oropharynx is clear.  Conjunctivae are clear. Trachea is midline, no goiter.  Chest:  Normal percussion note, well-healed VATS scar; fine inspiratory crackles 1/3 of the way up bilaterally with coarser crackles over the axilla.  Cardiac:  Normal apex beat, normal P2, no murmur, JVP less than 8 cm with equivocal HJR.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.  Extremities:  No edema, borderline clubbing, no cyanosis. 



Exercise oximetry:  Saturation at rest 96% and after treadmill ergometry 94%.



Pulmonary function tests today by my review show an FEV1 and FVC that are decreased by approximately 10%, total lung capacity decreased by 1 liter, and DLCO down from 20 to 14.



Weight is 238 lbs. (BMI 38).



Impression:



1.	Biopsy-proven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - The biopsy reading is somewhat unusual, and I will review this at our Pulmonary group weekly meeting, particularly with an eye to agents that might possibly target to exclude muscle metaplasia.  I continue to think him a relatively high risk candidate for the low-benefit regiment of prednisone, with an immunosuppressant agent.  I think he may be a very good candidate for gamma-interferon, but unfortunately not every one benefits from this.  



I emphasized strongly to he and his wife that his disease may have progressed, or could be made worse by the recent chest surgery and worsened gastroesophageal reflux.  If the disease was, indeed, progressing, we would need to proceed with lung transplantation workup.  The most significant contraindication currently to transplantation is his substantial obesity.  I calculated with him that he needed to have his weight down to 190 lbs. to get to a BMI of 30, and that by the time of listing he needed to have a BMI of approximately 32.  Hence, he has his work cut out for him.



2.	Obesity - As above.



3.	Diabetes.



4.	Possible coronary artery disease - He apparently did fine on his preoperative cardiac workup.



5.	GE reflux - As mentioned.



6.	Cough - Mainly due to GE reflux, and less prominent contribution from the pulmonary fibrosis.



Recommendations:



1.	Add Reglan 10 mg b.i.d.



2.	Continue Prilosec 40 mg b.i.d. - as 20 mg b.i.d. did not give full control with the generic pills.



3.	We will review pathology.



4.	Follow-up visit with full pulmonary function tests in one month.



5.	I strongly urged him to continue a steady, but progressive weight loss program - I expect that his life will depend upon it.  



It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.  Please feel free to call with any comments or questions.  



Sincerely, 





Paul N. Tam, M.D.

Patient is here for follow-up.



1.  Basal cell carcinoma.  Status post recent excision.



2.  CAD.  Patient hospitalized at Atlantic North Rehabilitation in mid-December after apparently experiencing some chest pain and being found to have an abnormal EKG.  He apparently had cardiac catheterization and an initial stent was placed, following this he had a stress test which showed some  continued changes and a second catheterization showed a second blocked vessel and a second stent was placed.  Medical regimen was adjusted.  I do not have any further details of this hospitalization and the above details are based on patient history.  He was started on Coumadin which she was told he would have to take for a limited period.  This is monitored from the ANRC.



3.  Diabetes.  Last HgbA1c was in October and was 7.7 which is a moderate improvement for him.  Reports compliance with his regimen.



Physical Exam



Patient is in no apparent distress.

Weight: 180 pounds

Blood Pressure: 130/68

Neck: supple without thyroidomegaly.

Lungs: Clear.

Cor. S1, S2 without gallops, rubs or murmurs.

Abdomen: non-tender,without organomegaly. 

Extremities: without edema. 



Assessment and Plan



1.  CAD.  Need more details of recent hospitalization.  Will center Atlantic North Rehabilitation Center for recent medical record.  For now he will continue on his current regimen.  He denies any recurrence of chest pain.



2.  Diabetes.  Continue current regimen.



I will see him for follow-up in two months.

Cora Quinley

MR# 759-87-55-2

March 3, 2077

 

As the responsible teaching attending, I can confirm both the

history and physical examination of Dr. Uriel Zapien. Briefly, the

patient is a 71-year-old female with several cardiovascular risk

factors. She was admitted to the hospital in January after a

prolonged episode of palpitations. The patient had a tiny

Troponin  elevation to 0.3, and the decision was made to manage

her conservatively. The patient continues to have these episodes

of palpitations, but she does not get chest pain with any

exercise.

 

Her current medical regimen includes aspirin, beta-blocker,

statin and an ACE Inhibitor. 

 

On physical examination she has 2+ carotids, which have normal

upstrokes and no bruits. Her lungs are clear to auscultation. Her

heart examination reveals a regular rate with a normal S1 and S2,

without S3 and S4.

 

Her electrocardiogram is normal.

 

Assessment: I concur with Dr. Zapien in that we will increase the

patient's beta-blockers to decrease her probable supraventricular

tachycardia. She will be seen back here in several months.

Attending Admission Note



HPI

52 year old woman with DM and h/o gastroparesis who presented with nausea and vomiting.  She was last admitted one week ago with N/V and treated for gastroparesis.  Her diabetes has been poorly controlled with her last hemoglobin A1c over 12 in April of 2081.  She has had recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting.  During this past year in January, she was admitted to Missouri Baptist Hospital.  She had a negative EGD, and HIDA scan showed low ejection fraction to cholecystokinase.  She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  She was admitted again a few weeks later to Missouri Baptist and had a gastric emptying study, which was consistent with gastroparesis.  In February, she was seen in the Philadelphia State Hospital Emergency Room with nausea and vomiting and had a KUB, which showed significant stool.  She presented again on 02/11/2081 and had an abdominal CT that showed thickening of the terminal ileum and possible thickening of the gastric and possible duodenal wall.  GI was consulted and the colonoscopy done on 02/14/2081 was normal, but did not visualize the terminal ileum.  A small-bowel follow-through on 02/16/2081 was normal.  She was discharged on a regimen of Reglan and erythromycin.  Since February, she has been seen multiple times in the outpatient clinic as well as medical walk-in.  She reports being complaint with her regimen of erythromycin 250 mg four times a day and Reglan 10 mg twice a day.  She was also recently started on Glucophage titrating up to 1000 mg b.i.d. as she had difficulty with multiple short per day regimen of insulin administration.  



She was admitted from 5/31-6/2 and treated with IV Zofran and enemas.  GI saw the pt and recommended increasing reglan to TID and adding colace and miralax.  She also had a head CT to r/o mass lesion causing the nausea, and this was negative.  At the time of d/c, her nausea had decreased.  She states that the N/V did not improve much since that admission, and she has not been able to eat much.  She has pain throughout her abdomen.  She denies f/c, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematemesis, or melena.

RE:  Edwin Workman
     MR #612-48-04-0
 
Dear Dr. Paz:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Workman in follow-up today. 
Overall, he is doing very well from a cardiovascular perspective. 
Unfortunately, he continues to gain weight but overall he is doing
well. 
 
His current medical regimen includes cyclosporin 150 b.i.d.,
prednisone 6 mg q.d., Imuran 275 q.d., Cardizem CD 300 mg q.d.,
Cardura 4 mg q.d., one baby aspirin a day, Axid 150 b.i.d.,
pravachol 20 q.d., magnesium oxide 250 mg b.i.d., calcium and
vitamin D, insulin NPH 54 units and 10 Regular in the morning, 32
units of NPH and 8 of Regular in the evening.  
 
On physical examination, he was obese.  Blood pressure of 150/90
with a heart rate of 85, weight was 305 pounds which is increased
5 pounds from September 21st.  Chest was clear to auscultation and
percussion.  Cardiac exam reveals a flat JVP at 30 degrees, a non-
displaced PMI with a normal S1, S2 without murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.  His abdomen
is obese, soft and nontender.  It is difficult to appreciate any
organomegaly.  There is no hepatojugular reflux.  Extremities are
without edema. 
 
Electrocardiogram reveals normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 85. 
Intervals of .16/.08/.34 with an axis of 60 degrees.  This is a
normal tracing unchanged from previous tracing.
 
Therefore, Mr. Workman is doing well from a cardiovascular
perspective.  We will make the necessary adjustments in his medical
regimen according to his laboratory results.  Unfortunately, he did
take his cyclosporin this morning and therefore he will mail his
labs back to us.
 
I did discuss with him attempting some weight loss with portion
control.  I think it might work to give him some reasonable goals
such as a weight loss of 30 pounds as apposed to 130.
 
Workman, Edwin
MR #612-48-04-0                    -2-            October 17, 2085
 
Mr. Workman will return in January for a biopsy and clinic visit.  
Best regards.
 
Sincerely,

NAME:     Usrey, John  

MRN:        6762675



Patient presents for follow-up visit after long hospitalization. He went in to have an

AAA repair and suffered a postop MI. He was in CCU for 3-4 weeks at which time

he sustained a Pseudomonas pneumonia, small bowel obstruction, and PE. He

subsequently had his CABG done at the end of April and was discharged at the end

of May to Grant Clinic. He did well at Grant Clinic and was discharged

from there on the 10th of June, and he presents to me for follow-up today. 



He states that he feels well. He denies any chest pain or trouble breathing since

discharge. He does not remember anything from his hospitalization otherwise. He is

mentally intact. He reports that he has not had a bowel movement for 3 days and had

some pain a couple of days ago. He is passing gas, last done yesterday. No dysuria.

His daughter reports that he is eating well, that he is at his baseline mental status,

that he has had not had any acute complaints at home. 



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As per HPI. Also, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder

due to a congenital AVM, osteoporosis, peripheral vascular disease.



ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 q.d., atenolol 25 b.i.d., Zocor 20 q.h.s.,

Carafate 1 gm p.o. b.i.d., Celexa 10 q.d., multivitamins, thiamine 100 q.d., Seroquel

37.5 q.h.s. and 12.5 q.a.m., Flomax 0.8 q.d., Synthroid 100 q.d., Dilantin 150 p.o. t.i.d.,

Colace 100 t.i.d. 



VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 112/52. Pulse 72. Weight 162. 



PHYSICAL EXAM: General - Elderly male in no acute distress. Appears well in

consideration of his recent long hospitalization. Neck - No JVD or bruits noted

bilaterally. Lungs - Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes or rales. CV -

RRR. Normal S1, S2. No murmurs. Abdomen - Positive bowel sounds heard in all 4

quadrants, although mildly decreased. Soft, mildly distended. No masses. No HSM.

No fluid wave. Extremities - He has 1+ firm pitting edema to his mid-shin. 



LABS: From June 13, 2091, show CBC with white count of 4.4, hemoglobin 11.2,

hematocrit 32.2. Chem 7 - BUN 26, creatinine 0.7, glucose 203, Dilantin 5.6. 



ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 76-year-old male, history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia,

coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, status post CABG in April as

well as AAA repair returns after an extended hospitalization with complications of

pneumonia, SBO, and PE who comes in for follow-up visit. Despite everything,

patient looks well. 



(1)  CV. Will continue cardiac medications at this time. Will likely change Zocor

     back to Lipitor but will check his labs first. Patient would benefit from cardiac

     rehab at this time. He is scheduled to see Dr. Nutter at the end of this

     month. Will arrange for him to have regular cardiac care after this. He has

     seen Dr. Quesnel for his postop CABG issues.



(2)  PVD. Patient status post AAA repair. He has seen Dr. Uddin and is doing

     well. 



(3)  Neuro. Patient on Dilantin 150 t.i.d. as per Dr. Acuna. It would be okay to

     decrease him to 100 t.i.d. as he was before. Will check  his levels today but

     likely decrease to 100 t.i.d. Will refer back to Dr. Acuna for follow-up. 



(4)  Endocrine. Will check TSH. Likely will continue current Levoxyl dose.



(5)  Osteoporosis. Okay to restart Fosamax.



(6)  GI. Patient with constipation. He can start Citrucel or Metamucil twice a day.

     Can also use Dulcolax daily until he has a bowel movement and then decrease

     to every other day as needed. Can also adjust fiber therapy as needed.

     Instructed patient and daughter that if patient is passing gas, it is okay.

     However, if he stops, they should call immediately. 



(7)  Psych. They should continue Celexa and Seroquel for now. Will review charts

     from Grant Clinic to see why medications were started and will likely

     taper him off them.



In general, need to review records from Grant Clinic in order to see what

happened there. Will consider that in my recommendations for his further care.

Return to clinic in 2 weeks.

CC: SOB



HPI: 75 yo woman with a history of R MCA, R cerebellar stroke, TIAs, Iliac vein thrombosis, PFO, and recent RP hematoma and rectus sheath hematoma (at GMH 8/13/87-8/26/87) currently off of anticoagulation because of her recent bleeds. 
Pt reports sudden onset of SOB this AM.  Not associated with any other symptoms.  A contractor who was at her home at the time called EMS who took pt to hospital.  En route she developed nausea and had 1 episode of NBNB emesis.  Otherwise, she denies CP, cough, fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting (other than the episode in the ambulance), change in bowel/bladder habits.  No exacerbating or alleviating symptoms.  Of note, she has some residual left sided weakness from her prior R MCA stroke and some balance issues from her cerebellar stroke.



In the ED the patient was tachypnic with SATS in the low 80s and  placed on oxygen by nasal cannula with improved sats on 4L to the mid 90s.  Then was able to be weaned to room air with sats still in the mid 90s.  She also was tachycardic to the 90s with BPs to the 90/60 with one episode of BP to 78 systolic.  She responded well to fluid with 2L in the ED and improved BPs.  CT showed stable RP and rectus sheath hematomas, no evidence of DVT or iliac thrombosis, and no evidence of PE.  CXR was clear.  



Of note, following her hospitalization at PROMPTCARE in July 2087 for TIA where she was found to have a small PFO and iliac vein thrombosis, she was started on Coumadin.  However, the patient was recently admitted to GMH with rectus sheath and RP hematoma.  Per the patient, she received 8 U PRBC there.  She also received FFP and vitamin K to reverse her Coumadin.  During her hospitalization she was in the ICU for hypotension and tachycardia.  An IVC filter was placed initially but subsequently d/c&#8217;d on 8/26/87.  She was discharged off of anticoagulation.

                                              10-19-87
 
 
 
HPI:  Ms. Youngman is a 30-year-old woman with diabetes who comes in for a 
regular follow-up.
 
Assessment and Plan:
1.   Diabetes.  She said she has been doing well, sticking to her diet, 
     has had no hypoglycemic episodes, and that her fingersticks have been 
     ranging between 120 and 160, never above and never below.  This is 
     borne out by her last hemoglobin A1C on 6-04-87 which was 4.9.  She 
     definitely does have good control, and she is working hard as her weight 
     is down to 236 lb from 238.75 on 6-29-87.  She had a recent hemoglobin A1C 
     and urine dip.  She, however, is due for an eye exam as she has no had one 
     for over a year and is willing to go, so I referred her.  She also needs 
     to see a Podiatrist as she has not seen one; she will go.
 
2.   Health maintenance.  Patient does not want a flu shot.  Otherwise, 
     she is up to date except for a Pap smear, but she had her daughter 
     with her so asked if she could have her Pap smear on her next visit.  
     We will do so.
 
3.   Migraine headaches.  She said she has had one every day recently.  
     This is worse than her usual.  The Motrin was not helping.  I 
     therefore prescribed Midrin and explained to her expressly how to 
     use.  Should this not help, she will page me as she knows how to do.  
     I will see her back soon to make sure this is getting better.
 
4.   Ankle pain.  Patient has chronic ankle pain.  She went to an 
     Orthopedist who told her a while back to lose weight and see if it 
     got better.  She has been slowly losing weight with no improvement 
     and would like to go back to the Orthopedist.  I therefore referred 
     her at her request.

Dictated on: 10/24/2088 by YOEL NEWCOMB, M.D. 



 

Patricia is a 70-year-old retired woman, right-hand dominant, who comes with complaints of soreness in her right wrist.  She apparently had a fall, which caused substantial pain and some swelling, but no bruising.  Brought her in to have an evaluation.  X-rays showed no fracture and over the last few weeks things have improved substantially, and she comes in just because she was told to get it checked out by her doctors, but otherwise feeling quite good and wondering if the appointment is even necessary.  

 

Past medical history includes high blood pressure and diabetes.  

 

No prior surgeries.  

 

No medications.  

 

No known drug allergies.  

 

Lists no family history of any problems.  

 

Lives alone and used to smoke, but quit.  

 

On examination, she has full range of motion of her wrist compared to the opposite side.  No atrophy, ecchymosis, edema or deformity.  Negative scaphoid shift test.  Slight tenderness over the distal radius.  Normal tendon function.  

 

My impression is that she must have got a mild sprain, which has recovered or possibly even a nondisplaced fracture given her age and osteoporotic bone, but whatever this was, it has resolved almost entirely, she is functioning well, and there is no apparent problem, so I will see her back as needed.

RE: VALDEZ, Harlan 
DHN#: 7672624 
DATE OF BIRTH: 11/09/2062 
CURRENT CLINIC VISIT DATE: 09/14/2109 
 
Dear Vicente, 
 
Thank you in advance for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan B. Valdez, a 46-year-old male patient with prior polysomnographic evidence of sleep disordered breathing, as well as a history of difficulty in sleep, reinitiation and maintenance and increased early morning awakenings, as well as mixed systemic medical conditions.  
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: As you already know, Mr. Valdez who demonstrates a history of difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance, as well as increased early morning awakenings, has noted an exacerbation of these sleep difficulties, occurring in temporal association with his loss of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year. He is now placed in the unfortunate situation of being a single parent to a 15-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter and describes a modification of his current employment duties of a set designer. In particular, Mr. Valdez describes undergoing on frequent international travelling which has bee markedly curtailed as he is tending to his family situation closer to home.  
 
He described a history of intermittent snoring symptomatology but is unaware of specific nocturnal respiratory pauses. He is unaware of a ""restless"" lower limb sensory complaints which may impact on his ability to initiate or reinitiate sleep. He denies a history of a "" night owl"" personality or circadian rhythm dysfunction which may have played a role with respect to nocturnal sleep disruptions or sleep difficulties.   
He denies a history of paroxysmal abnormal disturbances or associated narcoleptic symptoms.  
 
Mr. Valdez underwent an initial formal polysomnographic evaluation at the center for sleep diagnostics at Holy Cross on 11/26/05, during which time he was noted to demonstrate a respiratory disturbance index of 81/hour, particularly exacerbated in the supine position and characterized predominantly by hypopneas, with equal distribution during non-REM and stage REM sleep and with associated O2 desaturation Nadir of 88% The respiratory disturbances were predominantly obstructive or mixed hypopneas. In addition, loud snoring was noted.  
 
There was evidence of a sleep efficiency of 88% and a short sleep onset latency of 4 minutes. There was a predominance of ""light"" non-REM stages I-II sleep, and a concomitant inability to achieve significant ""slow-wave"" or stage REM sleep. There was also ""alpha intrusions and alpha delta sleep"" evident during the initial sleep study. In addition premature ventricular contractions were noted.  
 
The patient underwent a CPAP titration on 01/15/06, also at the Tenacre Foundation Nursing Home in Boxborough, during which time there was a marked reduction in the frequency of hypopneas (respiratory disturbance index equals 2/hour) with CPAP titrations between 4-6 cm. Sleep efficiency improved to 91%, a short sleep onset latency was also noted (3 minutes). There was once again an increased predominance of ""light"" non-REM stage I-II sleep, with concomitant inability to achieve sustained ""slow wave sleep"".  
 
Since his initial trial of nocturnal CPAP titration (at 6 cm of water pressure) and with various CPAP mask modifications (including CPAP nasal face mask and a Mallinckrodt ""Breeze"" supportive head gear with ""nasal pillows"". The patient describes associated claustrophobic symptomatology, relative difficulties with sustained nocturnal home CPAP use, and difficulties with regards to CPAP to being and complications by the bulkiness of the CPAP machine in general. As a result, he has not utilized nocturnal CPAP therapy for a period of time, although he still maintains the CPAP equipment in his house.  
 
Of particular note, and exacerbation of the past year, the patient demonstrates increased early morning awakenings (averaging 2-4 in number) with typical awakenings occurring approximately two hours after sleep initiation at 9:30 p.m. (the patient describes one awakening at 11:30 p.m. and the second awakening at 11:45 a.m., of unclear causative etiology). The patient then might awaken at 3 a.m. and be ""ready for the day"".  If he is able to reinitiate sleep thereafter, the patient may demonstrate additional two early morning awakenings after a final awakening at 6 a.m.  
 
The patient is noted to have a history of mixed systemic conditions including diabetes, coronary artery disease, depressive disorder, as well as a relatively stable gastrointestinal condition, with no upper GI evidence of gastroparesis.  
 
MEDICATIONS:  
1. Provigil 200 mg p.o. q. a.m. PRN.  
2. Lithium.  
3. Valproate.  
4. Glucophage 850 mg t.i.d.  
5. Humulin 15 units at night.  
6. Folate.  
7. Metoprolol.  
8. Cardia.  
9. Vitamin E.  
10. Coated aspirin.  
 
ALLERGIES/ADVERSE REACTIONS: The patient describes an enhancement to suicidal tendencies in association with prior Prozac usage.   
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies active tobacco or alcoholic beverage usage. He has lost 15-20 pounds over the past several years. His current weight is 195 pounds. He is desirous of losing some additional weight with regards to more regular exercise, but his hectic social situation makes this somewhat difficult at the present time.  
 
On examination, the patient demonstrates a blood pressure of 146/88, (seated, left arm), respiratory rate 16.  
 
HEENT EXAMINATION: Borderline small posterior oropharyngeal aperture, with slightly increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a slightly elongated uvula noted.  
 
The patient appears awake, alert, with speech clear and fluent and receptive language function essentially intact. He is presently wearing dental braces. No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated. No focal, sensory, motor or neurologic deficits are noted. No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence. The routine gait appears to be normal based, without evidence of significant gait dystaxias.  No current clinical ictal manifestations are present. No acute evidence of ""micro-sleeps"" are noted.  
 
IMPRESSION:  
1. Sleep stage/arrousal dysfunction (780.56): Manifested by subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, increased daytime fatigue and alternating hypersomnia, and recurrent polysomnographic evidence of ""lightened"" sleep pattern, with increased predominance of non-REM stages 1-2 sleep, and with the presence of ""alpha"" intrusions and ""alpha delta"" component to deeper sleep. These latter EEG findings have been described in association with subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, as well as clinical setting of chronic pain related complaints, depressive or anxiety disorder or intercurrent psychotropics agents used (but more usually associated with benzodiazepine or barbituate usage).  
2. Sleep disordered breathing: As evidenced during prior polysomnographic evaluations, mostly of obstructive and or mixed hypopnea. The patient appears largely refractory to a trial of CPAP therapy, particularly in so far as he demonstrates associated claustrophobic symptoms in association with it's usage, despite relatively modest CPAP water pressures (6 cm). In addition, he has tried various nasal CPAP face mask, including the Mallinckrodt ""Breeze"" supportive head gear with ""nasal pillows"" and with limited success. One might consider repeating a polysomnographic evaluation in the future, and if so, utilizing a potential trial of BIPAP titration, which may help to improve claustrophobic symptoms, but the patient will still be left with the issues referable to ""tangled tubing at night"" and issues referable to nasal face mask usage, as noted above.  3. Relative difficulties in sleep reinitiation and maintenance:  The patient describes at least 2-4 early morning awakenings with difficulty in sleep reinitiation and maintenance, thereby compounding his current sleep problem. While there would logically be a relationship between his current sleep exacerbations and the recent death of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year, there may also be evidence of other nocturnal sleep disturbances for which a repeat polysomnographic evaluation; i.e. in particular looking for the presence of increased spontaneous arousals or limb associated arousals or periodic limb movements of sleep may be of a special clinical benefit.  
 
PLAN:  
1. In the short course, in so far as the patient describes himself as being exceedingly tired, and unable to perform the routine daily tasks of work and managing a family in the absence of his deceased wife, I have suggested initiation of PRN Zolpidem tartrate therapy, 5 mg tablets, utilizing one to two tablets p.o.  q. h.s. PRN for difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance.  
2. The patient is advised to take Zolpidem tartrate therapy no more than 2-3 times per week, in an effort to avoid any issues of physiologic dependency.  
3. The patient was advised against potential adverse behavioral and or systemic side effects of Zolpidem tartrate therapy including  hypersomnolence, gastric upset, loose stools, diarrhea, and or cardiac palpitations.  
Pending his clinical response of his Zolpidem tartrate therapy, I then might seek direct treatment for his sleep disordered breathing issues which may include a repeat sleep study with potential trial of BIPAP therapy (in an effort to modify or attenuate claustrophobic symptoms). If he proves poorly responsive to trial of BIPAP therapy however, I might consider supplemental O2 therapy at night and, with this in mind a follow up sleep study should have associated end-tidal CO2 monitoring as well.  
4. In the meantime, the patient was advised to contact the sleep disorders clinic for any acute sleep related concerns in the interim.  
5. The patient may also benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches with regards to sleep reinitiation such as hypnotherapy, but I will hold off on these strategies pending follow up sleep disorders clinic evaluation (in approximately four months time).   
Once again, thank you again for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan Valdez. I hope this letter finds you well.  
 
Sincerely yours,

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an elderly patient, 82, with known diabetes and coronary artery disease, which has required placement of a pacemaker.



I last saw his blood sugar and it was 276 and his A1c in October was 7.  So, I had him back today to discuss diabetic management and also review his general health in terms of his diabetes and his other medications.



We went over his medications to start with and he is taking them exactly as it was shown in the computer.  These include atenolol 25, Glucotrol 10 twice a day, Actos 45, Lipitor 40 a day, Lasix 40 a day, and Procardia XL 60 mg q.d., and Coumadin.  He is followed by Dr. Itzel Jaimes for his cardiac problems and by a diabetologist at the Claiborne for managing his diabetes.



He had no other complaints.  His bowel movements are regular.  He still has nocturia x3 and was recently seen by a urologist who felt there was no need for any intervention.



He otherwise was in good spirits and has no immediate complaints.



His social situation, his allergies and and his family history and past medical history, are overall as previously recorded.  There are no other pertinent findings in the review of systems.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure was 140/60.  He looks well.  I did not measure his weight.  His heart rate was around 64-68.  His pupils are equal and reactive to light and extraocular movements were full.  Mucous membranes of the mouth and tongue were normal.  Lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam showed regular sinus rhythm, a normal S2 and no significant murmurs.  Liver and spleen were not palpable.  He had only 1+ peripheral edema which is less than usual.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He seems stable, I think the biggest problem is regulation of diabetes and I have asked him to get a hemoglobin A1c and to measure his blood sugar when he gets up in the morning and in the afternoon before he has supper.  He will come back to see me in about a month's time to follow up on these issues. CAD is stable with pacemaker



HGB A1c is 7.0, Hct is down to 31.6, epo 37, creatinine stable at 1.6, MCV 93.3.  Most likely anemia of chronic illness but need to check smear and stools

Mariners Hospital Internists

Grayling, ME 78726



Dear Fitzgerald:



  I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Haden Doty, in consultation today regarding his peripheral arterial disease and generalized vascular disease.  As you know, he is a patient that has known coronary artery disease, for which I ended up doing a catheterization on 08/27/2157, and that was done because of an abnormal stress test and chest pain.  At that time, he had been evaluated by Dr. Morgan Thayer, who performed a stress MIBI and demonstrated an inferoposterior ischemia, a low workload of 3 minutes and 18 seconds, and a heart rate of only 72% of predicted.  The LV chamber was dilated, and the ejection fraction was estimated at 48%, and there was a suggestion of global ischemia.  The catheterization demonstrated the presence of moderate diffuse coronary artery disease, plaque distributed throughout much of the coronary tree, some calcification, and narrow caliber vessels overall, but no focal high-grade stenoses.  There was some disease in the distal left main coronary artery, but his angina or ischemia was felt to be on the basis of excess demand in the phase of globally diminished supply.



He was treated medically for the coronary artery disease.  At the time of his cath, he also underwent an angiography of his abdominal aorta and selective angiogram of his left leg, because he was complaining of claudication predominantly on the left calf at that time.  That study demonstrated the presence of two renal arteries of the left side, a small superior one that was narrowed by about 50%, and a larger inferior left renal artery that was narrowed by about 60%.  The right side was patent.  With respect to the abdominal aorta, there was an ulcerated plaque just below the superior renal artery, narrowing the channel in the aorta by about 30% or 40%.  The iliac vessels were patent, and the left common femoral artery had some irregularity that was patent.  The left SFA, a diffusely diseased vessel, had a high-grade stenosis of about 80% in the adductor canal.  Then, at the trifurcation, there was occlusion or high-grade stenosis of all three trifurcation vessels on the left side.  There was reconstitution at the level of the ankle.



The decision at that time was made to treat him conservatively, at least for the present, since he was still playing golf three to four times a week.  He also apparently had some other issues, so I never saw him again in followup.  The original plan had been to bring him back for revascularization of his left renal artery and the left SFA.



He did have back surgery about a year ago when he became significantly crippled by his lumbar spinal stenosis.  Dr. Anders Sykes performed an L3-L4, L4-L5 decompressive laminectomy.  This had a dramatically positive effect on his back pain.



The biggest problem now is that he feels that he cannot walk as far and his exercise tolerance has decreased.  He has been an avid golfer in the past, but is now having some more difficulty with that.  Even when I saw him two years ago, he was using a cart to play three or four times a week.  He still is able to play golf, but if he walks about 100 yards, he starts feeling his calves, and now the symptoms are bilateral and equal.  He also has some numbness in his toes, which is constant, and his feet feel cold much of the time.  The symptoms of claudication have increased over the past couple of years.



His blood pressure has been reasonably stable.  He tells me that you get pressures of 120-130.  He has not been taking his blood pressure at home, but he does take a fair amount of medication, see below.



Of note, his son says that when he was in Michigan, he was playing 18 holes of golf regularly, sometimes a couple of times per day, but Haas notes that he was indeed limited by claudication even though he was able to play the golf down in Michigan.  He seems to be more limited up here since returning just a short time ago.  He also says that he feels like he has got to stay on the move, and if he does not play any golf at all, he will really deteriorate.  Of note, the discomfort is not only limited to the calves, but also there is some discomfort in the hips, though not nearly as bad and not as limiting.



Of note, he has been seeing Dr. Youngman for his legs and has been told to ""walk walk walk.""  At this point, he feels that he cannot walk as well or enough to follow through on his instructions.



Past medical history:

   As above.

Others include the following:

1.  Diabetes, type 2.

2.  Hypertension, with blood pressures as high as 220 at times in the past.

3.  Carotid bruits, though I do not have any readings from a Duplex ultrasound that was done a couple of years ago or so.

4.  Hyperlipidemia.

5.  Remote history of smoking, quit 40 years ago or so after 20 years of smoking.

6.  Peripheral neuropathy.

7.  Coronary artery disease, as described.

8.  Renal artery stenosis and PVD.



Current Medications:

  Avandia 4 mg QD

 Prilosec 20 mg QD

 atenolol 150 mg QD

 Imdur 60 mg QD

 lisinopril 40 mg QD

 Lipitor 5 mg QD

 metformin hydrochloride 500 mg 4 tabs qd

 aspirin 325 mg QD

 Tricor 54 mg 1 tab qd

 Norvasc 5 mg QD

 Plavix 75 mg QD

 nitroglycerin PRN

 Lasix 40 mg QD



Social history:

   He used to run a catering company.  Currently retired.  Plays golf a lot.  Likes to maintain a high level of activity.  Has two sons, one in Lake Wildwood, another in Baldwin City.  He has a daughter in Michigan.  Grandchildren - several.  He also has a great grandchild.



No smoking currently and only drinks occasional beer.  Occasional cup of coffee.



Review of systems:

   Positive for edema, 1+ in both legs.  He denies neurologic symptoms, sweats, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stools, or hemoptysis.  He does have night cramps and frequent urination at night.  He says he has some problems with vision with some intermittent blurring of his vision, but no monocular blindness.  He is set up to see an ophthalmologist soon.



Physical examination:

-Pulse:   64 and regular

-BP: 160/65    by my nurse, but I retook it at 130/60

-General:   He is a well-appearing gentleman, looks younger than his age of 82 years

-Heent:   Normal.  EOMI.  PERRL

-Neck:   Carotid upstrokes normal.  Bilateral bruits present, soft.  No JVD

-Chest:   Clear

-Cardiac:   Normal S1 and S2, soft S4, and a grade 1-2/6 murmur in the left lower sternal border

-Abdomen:   Soft, positive bruit, no organomegaly, and no enlargements of the aorta

-Extremities:   Femoral pulses 2+, bilateral bruits.  Below this, feet are warm and well perfused, with 1+ edema bilaterally.  Trace pulses in the dorsalis pedis on both sides, not sure how well I am feeling them.  Popliteal pulses are trace to 1+.  No ulcers or gangrene.  No tissue loss



EKG:

    - normal sinus rhythm at 64.  Normal axis and intervals, very minor nonspecific ST-T wave abnormality, essentially normal tracing.



Other Data:

   Date of Birth:  01/22/2077



Assessment and plan:

   1.  Obtain MRA of abdominal aorta, renal, and run-off arteries down to the ankle.  This will help give us a road map as to how we can approach revascularization of his legs to make him feel better.  I already know that I can open up his left SFA and probably his left trifurcation vessels below the knee, but I would like to see the right side and also get another look at the aortoiliac vessels, since it has been a full two years.

2.  Continue appropriate risk factor modification as you are doing.

3.  We will obtain blood work today in preparation for revascularization.

4.  I need to get carotid noninvasive studies, since it has been a couple of years anyway.



Impression:

   1.  Peripheral arterial disease - progressive claudication, now involving both legs at an equal amount and limiting him in terms of daily activities.  We know that he has high-grade disease in the left leg, below the groin, which can be treated.  Right leg has not been examined in the past.  Also has an ulcerative plaque in the aorta, which might be best left alone.

2.  Renal vascular disease - known moderately severe stenosis left main and accessory renal arteries.  Blood pressure is under reasonable control.  Need to check his creatinine and BUN.  If they are okay, then we would leave him alone.  He is however on a total of six antihypertensive medications, so consideration of renal artery revascularization is certainly something to entertain.

3.  Coronary artery disease - stable.

4.  Diabetes.

5.  Spinal stenosis - better since back surgery.

A/P: 66M with MMP including HTN, CHF, DM2, ESRD on HD, AF, and h/o PEA arrest who presents for routine follow up after recent bleeding AVF admission and ED visits.


#. CV: BP well controlled today, but in the absence of his wife it is entirely unclear what medications he is taking.  We had added imdur at our last visit for BP and antianginal control, and I had suggested re-starting Diltiazem.  It is unclear if either of these changes are occurring.  I will attempt to call his wife to discuss medication regimen, and we will hold on any changes for now.
       - F/u with Dr. Vest
       - Follow INR
       - Discuss current cardiac regimen with his wife


#. Oliguric ESRD: He had been doing well via his AVF but with recent sutures after bleeding they have been using his tunneled HD line, which now remains since 3/30/97 unless changed over wire at HD.  He is dialyzed at Ochsner Health Center Denham Springs in Pahrump. His Nephrologist is Dr. Frank Marquez, and he is pageable at951-440-0959 (Northwest Hospital).  


#. GI: His LFTs are now normal, and his HCV viral load/genotype have not been able to be determined.  It is possible that he has cleared HCV infection in the past.  We will continue to follow HCV viral  load and consider referral to GI to discuss treatment if LFTs rise of unclear etiology.  His synthetic function is mostly preserved.  #. DM2: Again, in the absence of his wife it is difficult to determine his current regimen.  Last A1C was 6.0, and with recent evidence we will continue his current regimen.
  
#. OSA: Sleep study completed, qualifies for CPAP, and using with good effect.  


#. Other: Repeat utility letter

   Cardiology Admission for Dr. Paulson

69 y.o. male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, CAD and CABG September 2092 presents today to ODC ED with progressively worsening shortness of breath and intermittent left jaw pain. 

The patient reports having undergone CABG in September 2092 at WMMC after developing jaw pain and shortness of breath. He was told at that time that there might be a problem with one of the grafts. Surgery otherwise uneventful. He was discharged home and developed recurrent symptoms. Cardiac catheterization was performed in early Jan 2093 at BS which, by his report, showed one occluded graft. He underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD, but never really improved. Relook coronary angiography was performed about 2 weeks later showing no change. He saw Dr. Paulson for 2nd opinion about 2 months ago. His review of angio from Jan: SVG to mid RCA patent, LIMA to 2nd diagonal patent, SVG to LAD not seen and extensive LAD disease. LAD intramyocardial. LV function normal. Ranexa was added however he has not noted any improvement in jaw pain. He has progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and intermittent exertional left jaw pain partially relieved by 2 s.l. TNG. Despite greatly curtailing his activities, he is having daily symptoms. He has been enrolled at cardiac rehab but can only bicycle 2.8 mins. He phoned Dr. Paulson's office today and was advised to come to the ODC ED for evaluation.

In the ED, he appears comfortable and painfree. Did note some left jaw pain earlier. HR 73 SR, BP 122/71, O2 sat 98% RA. ECG showed NSR rate 71, incomplete RBBB with LAFB, LAE, TWI V1-V2-no important change c/w prior tracing 2/18/93. BNP, CK-MB, and TnT normal. CXR shows clear lungs.

In light of his history of CAD, CABG, prior PCI, and progressive symptoms, admitted for further evaluation.

A/P: 61 yr old female with likely bacterial respiratory infection in the setting of longstanding bronchiectasis. She has failed a recent course of Telithromycin in the setting of moraxella culture positive sputum. We will repeat sputum cultures and start vancomycin and ceftriaxone IV here. We will get Chest Films and supplement her home pulmonary regimen with Nebulized albuterol q 4 hrs.  I have encouraged frequent ambulation. She will continue to use her home flutter valve. Her husband provides Chest PT at home and we may order this if appropriate in house.



We will continue her home Inderal at 240 mg qd. This will be supplemented with an ACE I and hydralazine as necessary. The use of an ACE I will be discussed with her PCP as this may have been avoided second to chronic cough. She is not a candidate for Lasix or HCTZ due to her sulfa allergy. Her admission BP of 187/97 was in the setting of a delay in today's dose of inderal. She was asymptomatic with this high pressure. 



We will continue her hormone replacement, GERD prophylaxis with nexium and nightly nortryptiline.  She will be ambulatory and not require DVT prophylaxis.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Greenwood comes in to urgent care clinic for
hives after taking Keflex.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She is a 47-year-old woman with
chronic hydradenitis suppurativa since the age of 18 in her left
axilla and her groin.  She has been to the emergency room
multiple times for purulent drainage around her groin.  She has
been given multiple courses of antibiotics including Keflex and
dicloxacillin.  She is planning to have her disease surgically
managed in the next few months.  She most recently presented to
the emergency room on January 7, 2079 with swelling and drainage
of her hydradenitis in her groin.  She was given a prescription
of Keflex.  Shortly after taking the first tablet, she developed
itching in the hands, face, and legs and as well as hives.  She
denied any shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or loss of
consciousness.  She called the emergency room and was instructed
to stop taking Keflex as this was most likely an allergic
reaction.  So now, she is here for follow up from that.  She said
shortly after stopping antibiotic her symptoms of hives and
itchiness have improved very quickly.  She is still complaining
of purulent drainage around her groin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes.

MEDICATIONS:  Glucotrol, Percocet as needed for pain.

ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to erythromycin and now Keflex.  She
gets hives from both.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her left axilla looks dry.  Her bilateral
groins looks red, swollen tender with some serous as well as some
purulent drainage.  There is no fluctuance that I could feel.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Worsening of her hydradenitis.  Given the
recent allergy to Keflex, we will obviously need to take a
different antibiotic.  She has been on dicloxacillin in the past
with good result.  Despite the 15% cross allergy of dicloxacillin
compared to Keflex, I think dicloxacillin is a good choice for
now.  If this does not work, I think one should consider
clindamycin for treatment.  I will go ahead and give her 14 days
worth of dicloxacillin and I instructing her to notify M.D. if
she develops any allergic reaction to this medicine.  I also gave
her 60 tablets of Percocet as well as renewed her renewed her
prescription of Glucotrol XL 2.5 mg a day.  She should see her
PCP in two weeks.

Punta Gorda, OK 98634

Dear Whitney:

  I was pleased to see Michelle Klein this morning for a post hospitalization followup evaluation.  You know Michelle well, she does have coronary artery disease, has had an LAD stent placed in 2148, and had a normal stress sestamibi study in November 2151.  She has moderate mitral insufficiency.  Her left atrial dimension is 52 and RV pressure 42.  She is diabetic and has hypertension.  She was hospitalized with a diarrheal bleeding issue attributed to salmonella infection attributed to tomatoes it also affecting her husband and this was accomplished at the Copley Hospital.

Her medications were modified somewhat.  She presently takes atenolol 50 mg a day, verapamil 120 mg per day, Lipitor 10 mg a day, Diovan 80 mg per day, they held her aspirin and her Imdur, she takes Prilosec 40 mg BID, and metformin 500 mg BID.  Her blood pressure remains high today at 147/70, it had been similar range when I saw her in June this year.  Pending her diarrhea at home, we may need to go back up on some of her medications, but at this point we will change.  She is symptom free vis-a-vie her heart.

Her exam shows no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Normal thyroid, normal neck veins, and arteries.  Clear lungs.  Normal abdomen, nontender, and no mass felt.  Her heart palpates normally.  There were no thrills and no scars.  Her first sound is soft and second is normal.  There is a 1/6 apical mitral insufficiency murmur with positive response to isometrics.  There were no diastolic murmurs.  Blood pressure is 145/70.

The electrocardiogram was normal with trace nonspecific ST flattening.

I will plan to reassess Michelle in four months and she will have a recheck several times a month of her blood pressure at home and she will send diaries to me.  If her blood pressure is continued at home to be in her present level, we will advance her medications to accommodate this.  If there are any questions feel free to call me.

Sincerely yours,

ASSESSMENT

Mr. Ishida is a 78 y/o M with h/o CKD, HTN, and NIDDM p/w sustained dizziness and altered mental status. Mr. Ishida is most likely currently in a volume depleted stated. He had diarrhea induced by the contaminated water from the storm and only maintained his hydration with a meager 2 or 3 bottles of Coca-cola over several days. This in combination with his output of fluid from diarrhea, his diuretic medication, and possible osmotic diuresis (increased serum glucose level from soda intake in a diabetic) could have shifted him into hypovolemia. Thus Mr. Ishida might have decrease effective arterial volume causing his BUN/Cr ratio to be elevated, indicating a prerenal process. Although BUN/Cr ratio is not &gt;20, we can still assume that he has prerenal ARF considering his use of diuretics and h/o CKD which can decrease the sensitivity of BUN/Cr rations and FENa for assessing etiologies of renal failure. Mr. Ishida additionally uses NSAIDs (e.g. Naproxen), an ARB and an ACEI, all of which are associated with decreased intraglomerular pressure and renal vasoconstriction which can lead to prerenal ARF.

Intrinsic ARF is less likely considering he is not using any overtly nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. amphotericin, cisplatin, or aminoglycosides. Conversely, he is at an increased risk of cholesterol emboli given his h/o of hypercholesterolemia and vasculopathy.

      Lastly, Mr. Ishida my have a postrenal ARF etiology considering his h/o BPH which could lead to obstruction of the outflow tract leading to increased pressures in the ureters flowing back up into the kidneys.

      Mr. Ishida&#8217;s dizziness and altered mental status are both explained by ARF. Additional explanations of altered mental status are ruled out via the history and physical including intoxication, brain hemorrhagic, brain tumor, etc.

PLAN

#) Acture Renal Failure

-Continue fluids and hydration: 1L of IV saline over the next 24 hrs

-D/c naproxen use.

-Rule out Post-renal etiology: use ultrasound to assess the size of the bladder and ureters. If enlarged bladder and ureters are found the diagnosis is more likely postrenal ARF due to an enlarged prostate. Thus the patient should be assessed by Urology of possible partial prostatectomy.



#) DM

-Discontinue metformin due to possibility of metabolic acidosis and hospital drug interactions.

#) CAD

      -Switch Atenlol to metoprolol given ARF

#) HTN

-Discontinue lisinopril, valsartan, furosemide until pt&#8217;s renal condition improves.

#) Gout

      -D/C allopurinol until pt&#8217;s renal condition improves

#)Hypercholesterolemia

-Continue simvastatin as previously prescribed (Simvastatin  20 MG PO QHS)

#) Psoriasis

-Continue Ammonium Lactate 12% Cream and Calcipotriene 0.005%   TOP BID prn

#)Benign Prostate Hypertrophy

      -Continue Finasteride and darifenacin as previously prescribed.

History of Present Illness:  
Per Dibble General Hospital Records, the patient was admitted on 2/04/33 after collapsing in the mall.  His total time down is unclear, but the patient had an AED administered and he was shocked x2.  When EMTs arrived, they found the patient to be in VF w/ agonal breathing.  CPR was administered and he was shocked x3.  After the 3rd defibrillation, the patient awoke and was in NSR.  The patient could not recall any of the events.  

At DGH, was hemodynamically stable and did not have a recurrence of malignant arrhythmia.  His EKG showed TWI v3-v6.  His troponins went from 0.01-0.27-0.34, CK 451 w/ MB 28 (full laboratory values not available).  TTE showed depressed LV function w/ EF 30%, w/ apical apical dyskinesis.  Head CT was negative for acute process.  His mental status demonstrated slowly recovering delirium.  He was found to have a pneumonia and treated with ceftriaxone/azithromycin.

EKG SB at 57bpm, Q in v1, III/AvF, left axis, TWI in v3-v6, new from previous.  QTc 430ms (manually calculated)
CXR enlarged cardiac silhouette, L basilar opacity.

Impression/Plan: 
68yoM h/o HTN/HL, schizophrenia, medication non-compliance presents s/p VF arrest, NSTEMI, AMS.  Patient likely had ischemic VT/VF.  Per outside records, the patient does not seem to have ongoing activity of his acute coronary syndrome.  His mental status continues to be poor, and is likely multifactorial; my suspicion is that he does have some level of anoxic brain injury as the dominant pathology.

NSTEMI:  npo p MN for cardiac cath in AM.  Patient not able to consent at this point, and does not have any clear family members that can do this for him.  Will follow his mental status exam.
	-aspirin, metoprolol, lipitor, heparin IV.
	-can add ACEi when he is taking po   s and if BPs need further titration.
	-mucomyst for renal prophylaxis.
	-for risk factors, check a1c.
S/P VF ARREST: likely in the setting of NSTEMI
	-cath as above.
	-nl QTc
	-s/p amio IV load.  C/w amiodarone po load.  If reversible lesion, likely can d/c.
AMS: anoxic brain injury; current somnolence likely from narcotics.
	-appreciate neurology consultation
	-head CT
	-c/w home zyprexa.  Haldol prn.
BRONCHOSPASM: does not have significant smoking history.  ? aspiration vs cardiac wheezing
	-albuterol/ipratropium nebs standing, and prn.
	-gently diurese
	-finish course of antibiotics; ceftriaxone/azithromycin until 2/12.
CHF: mild failure
	-lasix 40iv x1.  goal TBB    500-1L
	-follow creatinine, as he apparently bumped at OSH.
U/A: check urine culture
FEN: npo while somnolent.  Otherwise, low fat/chol, no added salt.  
PROPHY:  on heparin IV.
CODE: FULL (patient cannot answer for himself)
DISPO: PT, OT, SLP eval

HAYNES, DALILA

78361343

04/14/2104



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Haynes is a 69-year-old woman who comes in followup of her recent hospitalization and rehabilitation.  She is here with her daughter.  She notes that she is mostly feeling tired lately.  She is able to walk with help and is even unable to walk upstairs with assistance.  She is here in a wheelchair and says she is kind of tired and lets her daughter gives most of the history even when asked simple questions.  She has been checking her blood sugars and she shows me the results.  In the morning, the sugars have been fairly low in the 57-100 range, around noontime high at 144 up to 398, and in the evening high again 176-245.  She is taking Lantus 38 units at 9:00 p.m. and she is on NovoLog coverage less than 25-0 units, 125-152 units, 151-204 units, 201-256 units, 251-308 units and greater than 310 units.  She would like to switch over her Lantus to the Pens since the pen is so much easier for her.  She complains of hemorrhoids, although she says they are actually getting better, she had previously had four now she has two.  There is no bleeding.  There is no pain, kind of itchy and uncomfortable.  She is in fact not having any problem with constipation at this time.  She is having bowel movements every day.  She is not having any chest pain, no trouble breathing, no fevers, sweats or chills.  No abdominal symptoms.  She notes her stomach is really fine and it just not causing any trouble at all.



MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, lisinopril 40 daily, Lantus 38, NovoLog coverage, omeprazole 40 daily, metoprolol, potassium chloride, Lasix 40 daily, Pravachol 40 nightly, and Symbicort.



ALLERGIES:  Bactrim GI intolerance, fluticasone, cough and sucralfate unknown.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  She has never smoked, no alcohol, no street drugs.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Well developed, well nourished, no acute distress.  Blood pressure 121/65, pulse 106, weight 169.8, and temperature 98.6.  A delightful woman, English speaking and sitting in a wheelchair.  Quite alert, did know the president, could not recall the vice-president or against whom the president ran in the last election.  She did know the day of the week and she knew where she was.  She also remembered to remind me about a prescription when both her daughter and I almost forgot.  She is an absolutely delightful woman, appears well and alert despite the fact that she lets her daughter provides most of the history and responses.  She appears comfortable, breathing easily, no use of accessory muscles of inspiration, speaking in full sentences, no cough, no spine or flank tenderness.  Heart sounds S1, S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, rub or gallop.  Chest is clear to auscultation anteriorly and posteriorly with no rales, wheezes, or rhonchi.  She is clear to percussion.  Extremities:  Without edema, cyanosis or clubbing, no calf tenderness.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Diabetes.  Her A1c today was 6.6, which represents excellent control despite a fairly high glucoses she was recording.  I therefore did not want to increase her regimen despite the high glucoses.  We will continue for now.  I did give her an appointment with the diabetes nurse for help in management of her diabetes.

2.  Hypertension.  Her blood pressure is fine.  We will continue current regimen.  We will check electrolytes.

3.  Tachycardia actually improved relative to her last visit.  She is asymptomatic in this regard except for some fatigue.

4.  Fatigue.  This is most likely due to stepping down from the prednisone 60-40.  This is what the patient and her daughter believe.  She was somewhat fatigued before, but they note that it is worse with this.  She does need to come off the prednisone and Dr. Villalpando who she just saw is going to try to come up with another plan for her. Check cbc.

5.  Acid associated symptoms well controlled with omeprazole.

6.  Right knee mild osteoarthritis, not a problem today.

7.  CNS syphilis status post treatment.

8.  Question of CNS sarcoid currently on 40 mg of prednisone and hopefully she will be able to come off of that and perhaps get started on something else.

9.  Cholesterol.  We will recheck her cholesterol today and will check an SGPT.

10.  Thyroid nodules.  Ultrasound in July 2103 showed stability.

11.  Adrenal adenoma.  Her CAT scan in May 2102 showed stability and some adenopathy consistent with sarcoid.

12.  Lichen simplex chronicus.  Dermatology diagnosis from 2101.  Not addressed today.  Hopefully, she will be stronger at her next visit and we can recheck.

13.  Osteopenia.  She will continue calcium and vitamin D.  I encouraged weightbearing exercise as tolerated.

14.  Glaucoma suspect, not addressed today.

15.  Small vessel ischemic disease.  MRI from July showed changes consistent with small vessel ischemic stroke.  She is currently on aspirin and stable.

16. Hemorrhoids - anusolHC given. Given no bleeding and no pian, this hopefully will fuffice. Recommended avoiding constipation, as she is doing, with lots of dietary fruits and vegetables.



HgA1C 6.6
CBC slightly elevated WBC likely due to prednisone
SGPT, lytes o.k.
CHOL LDL 1124 elevated but HDL also high, protective, cntu pravachol and rercheck
letter sent

RE:		Ordonez, Mrs.
SNH#:		008-37-16 

March 21, 2087

Reason for visit:  Patient is a 59 year old woman seen today together with Dr. Barajas.

MEDICATIONS:  She is currently on atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., HCTZ 50 mg q.d., Zestril 20 mg q.d.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 150/80 with a pulse of 76.  

PLAN:  
1.	I would increase her atenolol to 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg in the late afternoon.
2.	Diabetes is in suboptimal control, despite maximum dose Micronase.  Creatinine of 1.4 would argue against using Glucophage.  Check hemoglobin A1C and then we will decide on her medication.

Kekela Team 3 Intern Admission

Name:  Danny Nielson
MR#:  9156593
Admit Date: February 21, 2098
Onc Attending:  Dr. Quadri
Onc PA: Edward Quiambao
PCP: Ulises Lopez
Admitting intern: Ulyssa Neff
Code: FULL

Source: Patient

Chief Complaint:  diarrhea

History of Present Illness:  
77-year-old gentleman with Stage IIIB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s/p 4 cycles of CHOP-R with increased PET avidity of left groin nodal mass and biopsy c/w DLBCL then s/p R-ICE cycle #2. Now s/p 40 gray XRT to limited recurrence site in left groin. He was hospitalized recently for neutropenia and fevers, received cefepime and vancomycin, and was discharged on 2/2/2098.  As per d/c summary, he received cefepime for E. coli and VRE UTI (though this is a little confusing since urine culture negative that admission, and positive for these organisms in 11/2097).  During most recent admission he was found to be C. diff positive, but appears to have had incomplete course of Flagyl.  Since discharge, patient reports    not feeling the same.     He has had crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, and experienced some lightheadedness this morning.  

ROS:  Denies fevers, sweats, chills.  Denies HA.  Denies CP, respiratory sx, urinary difficulty, N/V.  

Past Medical History: 
1.	Wegener's granulomatosis 
2.	bilateral knee repair 12 years ago
3.	right-sided hip repair
4.	diabetes mellitus type II 
5.	hiatal hernia
6.	coronary artery disease
a.	Cath from 11/2097: Severe left main (60% ostial), mid LAD (60%), and RCA (100%), patent LIMA
7.	renal transplant donor in the 2060s
8.	aortic stenosis with (valve area 1 peak trans AV gradient is 37 mmHg)
9.	CHF (EF 36%)
10.	atrial flutter s/p cardioversion
11.	diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

ONC history - as per prior notes
3/97: Mr. Nielson was in his usual state of health until he presented with LLE edema and bilateral groin swelling, left>right.
4/97: CT scan of the abdomen revealed retroperitoneal adenopathy. CT scan of the pelvis revealed a chain of retrocrural nodes in front of the aorta and vena cava as well as bulky adenopathy in the external iliac chain with an iliac mass measuring 3.0 to 3.5 cm in diameter on the left side.  The largest node in the inguinal area measured approximately 6.0 cm.  
4/18/97: biopsy of left groin mass c/w DLBCL. CD20+, CD 79a+, Pax5+, CD30-, CD15- 
4/97: PET: Increased FDG uptake throughout the retroperitoneum, left pelvis and proximal left lower extremity which corresponds with extensive lymphadenopathy.
4/24/97: Bone Marrow Biopsy: without evidence of involvement
5/01/97 Cycle #1 of CHOP-R at 75% Adria and Cytoxan dose
5/22/97 Cycle #2 of CHOP-R at 100% Adria and Cytoxan dose - Neulasta
6/5/97: PET: Interval enlargement of left groin mass but less intense FDG uptake. Enlargement in size may represent necrosis from treatment effect. Improvement in left iliac adenopathy and resolution of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Small pancreatic body cystic lesion - may be IPMT. 
6/12/97: Cycle #3 of CHOP-R at 100% Adria and Cytoxan dose - Neulasta
7/4/97: Cycle #4 of CHOP-R at 100% Adria and 75% Cytoxan dose - Neulasta
7/6/97: PET: No signficant change in left external iliac and left inguinal hypermatabolic lymphadenopathy, likely right greater trochanteric bursitis
7/97: Re biopsy left groin: DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA. AREAS OF FIBROSIS AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION
8/1/97 Cycle #1 of R-ICE with dose-reduced Ifos and carboplatin because of nephrectomy.
8/31/97 Cycle #2 of R-ICE with dose-reduced Ifos and carboplatin
9/20/97 - 11/8/97 - 40 gray XRT to left groin
1/23/98 - PET/CT with slight local progression of left thigh lesion by CT

CC/ID: 74 yo male with Abdomainal pain



HPI:  74 yo who was in 11/96 HOB for abdominal pain and worsening of this incomplete paraplegia.  For more details please see HOB d/c summary 12-11-95 and his Lakeland Hospital d/c summary from 5-19-2096.  As an inpatient he developed a sacral decubitus ulcer which became large.  During his rehab stay at LH, he was being followed by they HOB wound clinic for management of his sacral ulcer with a vac dressing.  The wound progressed until he presented to the EW 8/96 with frank fecal contamination of a stage 4 ulcer.  He thus had a diverting colostomy on 8/23/96 to allow his ulcer to heal.  he presented to the EW today with one day of abdominal pain, distention and nausea.

Patient was admitted to the observation unit at JCH overnight because of his complaints of chest pain.  Plan had been to cycle enzymes and provocative testing, however, this am patient adamantly refused to stay in hospital and understanding leaving included incomplete evaluation of chest pain and risk of death, patient signed out AMA.



I left the obseration unit to walk downstairs and find patient signing into the ER ""I want to go to detox""

Asked patient why he left OU to just come back to the hospital and he said ""There is nothing wrong with my heart"".



Patient also reports he thought he had a place to stay but after making a few phone calls, realized he had nowhere to go to spend the night.

RE: Otis Narvaez

        MR   #04561326

 

Dear Dr. Huynh:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Oscar Narvaez in 

consultation.  As you know he is a 63-year-old gentleman with a history 

of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.  Recently, he underwent 

evaluation prior to intestinal bypass surgery in which he underwent 

dobutamine stress echocardiography.  The echocardiogram revealed reduced 

left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 35 to 40 percent.  

There was no evidence of ischemia.  He subsequently underwent coronary 

catheterization.  I do not have those results, but he claims that he was 

told that he had no arterial blockages.  Symptomatically, he is 

significantly short of breath with minimal exertion.  He has attributed 

this to his weight.  He was started on an ACE inhibitor and diuretic, 

although he has not been taking either of these medications.  Prior to 

his catheterization a chest x-ray revealed a 1.5 cm nodule in the left 

upper lobe of the lung that was not present in 2067.  This was confirmed 

subsequently on CT scan, suggesting that this was most likely a primary 

lung malignancy.  He is therefore scheduled for mediastinoscopy with 

you.

 

His past medical history is remarkable for diabetes, hypertension, low 

back pain, and obesity.

 

Current medications include glucophage 1000 mg po q.d., Ritalin 80 mg po 

q.d., Celexa 10 mg po q.d., Neurontin.  No drug allergies

 

Family history is remarkable for heart disease in his father.

 

Social history: he works as a consultant in the Morris area.  He smoked for 

40 years but quit approximately three years ago.  He drinks rarely, 

although drank heavily in the past.

 

RE: Otis Narvaez

       MR  #04561326                                      -2-                 

                       

December 30,  2072                                         

 

Review of systems is remarkable for shortness of breath.  He denies 

gastrointestinal complaints.

 

On physical exam he is obese but well appearing with a blood pressure of 

140/70 and a pulse of 80 and regular.  HEENT is unremarkable, neck 

supple without thyromegaly, no jugular venous distention, carotids full 

without bruits, chest clear to auscultation and percussion.Cardiac exam: 

regular rate and rhythm, PMI nondisplaced, normal heart sounds, no 

murmurs or rubs.  Abdomen benign nontender without hepatosplenomegaly or 

CVA tenderness.  No clubbing cyanosis or edema.  Pulses full.

 

Impression: Mr. Narvaez has evidence of decreased left ventricular 

function by echocardiogram.  By report he has no evidence of coronary 

artery disease, although I have not seen this report myself.  If indeed 

it is true that he has no coronary artery disease, then my guess is that 

this represents a primary cardiomyopathy or cardiomyopathy secondary to 

his diabetes or even his history of alcohol abuse.  In any case, this 

puts them at increased risk for an operation, although probably less so 

than if he had significant coronary disease.  I see no reason why you 

should not proceed with the biopsy that is planned immediately.  Prior 

to his operation, he should be placed on ACE inhibitor and diuretic.  

I'll be happy to continue to see him should he care to transfer his care 

to South Side Hospital.

 

Sincerely yours,

 

 

 

Kevin Y. Kirkpatrick, M.D.

Interim History:	

Comes to review diabetes and related problems.

He feels that he gets tired and needs to rest more after doing any exercise. He denies shortness of breath or chest pain, but he is not just describing generalized fatigue in that this is clearly related to physical exercise. He has not had an ETT since April, 2122.

He told me in 2119 that he had had a PneumoVax, but did not know exactly when.



Social History: 

His wife has had walking difficulty after radiation therapy for her gynecologic malignancy. She sees Dr. YAEL Pratt.



Social History:

He retired. A new management gave him 3 hours to decide whether to retire or to work nights.

Physical Exam:	

Looks well.

BP:   126/60		P:   72, regular	

Wt:   148.5 without shoes, down 17 since May !

HEENT:	Anicteric. 

Carotids:	Normal pulses, without bruits

Chest:	Clear to auscultation

Heart:	Normal S1; physiologic S2.  S4.  2/6 systolic ejection murmur

Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness. No palpable AAA. 

Extremities:	Trace edema.         DP absent R, 1+ L.   PT absent.   There is an area at medial tip of L great toe with ? underlying dark blood and overlying callus that is of concern.



Impressions and Plan:	

Would check some BS before supper as well.

I have several concerns:

Could his exercise-induced fatigue be an angina-equivalent? Will defer to Dr. Brian with respect to the need for another ETT.

His weight loss continues, without explanation. Dr. Chandler is aware of this.

His L great toe is of concern. Dr. Aldridge has been following this area and he will continue to follow-up with him.

RE:  Peggy Tinsley
     MR #236-67-03-3
 
Dear Dr. Ventura:
 
Peggy Tinsley was seen in the renal clinic today.  This patient
with end stage renal disease secondary to diabetes was initiated
on hemodialysis 2 weeks ago in MH.  She has been doing well
except for the complaint of fevers and rigors intermittently for
the past week.  There is no history of cough, dyspnea, or chest
pain.  She denies any dysuria, urgency, or frequency.  Her blood
sugars at home have been between 120 and 180.  
 
Her current medications include Tums 5 to 6 tabs with meals,
Erythropoietin, Premarin and Provera, Nephrox 150 mg tid, insulin
NPH 10 units qam.
 
On July 17, after hemodialysis, Ms. Tinsley was given a partial
dose of Vancomycin and developed pruritus.  CBC at the time
revealed a white count of 6.2 with a hematocrit of 25.2.  Blood
cultures were sent.
 
On examination today this lady appeared well with a BP of 110/60
and a pulse of 88.  She was afebrile.  Head and neck examination
was unremarkable and chest was clear to IPPA.  On cardiovascular
examination JVP was at the sternal angle and there was no
peripheral edema.  Heart sounds were normal.
 
Urinalysis did not reveal and white cells and contained 3+
protein and 2+ glucose.
 
Miss Tinsley should be followed up at her dialysis center. 
There does not appear to be any evidence of a graft infection. 
She should also have a urine sent for culture to rule out urinary
tract infection.  Because of her early satiety she has been
eating poorly and we might suggest that she be started on a
gastroprokinetic agent such as Cisapride 10 mg qid.

Can increase lisinopril to 10 this visit and titrate thereafter.

I would favor addition of diuretic, HCTZ, for additional management and anticipate BP mgmt will require further polypharmacy.

She is returning on 2/2/93 and will have NP visit.

3. Musculoskeletal pain/deconditioning.

RLE radiculopathy has resolved fairly spontaneously, as did the contralateral presentation, without intervention. She needs to recondition, increase range of motion and physical capacity in order to improve stamina and strength.

She has opted not to follow through with PT.

4. CAD.

Cont ASA, statin, BB, ACE.

5. DM.

Cont glipizide; continue ACE I as above. 

BG 125 today.

6. Lupus nephritis.

Cr stable. 

She has asked me to renew immunomodulatory agents but I would like to defer to rheumatology service.

7. HCM.

Stable. 

Requesting female provider to perform breast/pap. Scheduled for 2/2/93.

John V. Hood, MD

Attending note:

Pt discussed with Dr Hood, and agree with his evaluation and plan. 

Neck Sx as described. I don't feel a mass or adenopathy, but worth further evaluation with CT, barium swallow if sx persist. BP needs better control, goal 130/80, addition diuretic and increase in ACE-I appropriate.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Single, works for the Alaska Air Group in Juneau, drinks 1-2 beers a year.  He is a nonsmoker, does not use IV drugs, he is responsible to take care of several sick individuals that are very close to his life, therefore he claims he cannot attention to his own personal health because of caring for others.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presents today for annual physical.  The patient states he has become enlightened recently that when he goes to Tim Horton's, they pretreated his coffee with sugar as a role and he thinks that is the reason for his diabetic, lack of control over the years.  He has been eliminating concentrated sweets in his diet.  After a while, his blood sugars have gotten much better by his report.  He recently had an eye examination showing stable background retinopathy without any recent changes.  He has had no active podiatry issues over the past 2 months has had no recent chest pain, shortness of breath or PND.  He sees Dr. Isaac Ulibarri for a cardiomyopathy standpoint.  With his AICD everything seems to be working fine according to him when they interrogate his device.  He reports no fever, shakes, chills, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  Again, he has had no recent chest pain, PND, or orthopnea.  He has had no dysphagia, odynophagia, melena, hematemesis, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria or polyuria.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 126/70 in the right arm, temperature 95.6, pulse 78, respirations are 16, O2 sat 97% on room air.  He is 67 inches tall, 222 pounds.  BMI 34.8.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils are equally round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements were intact.  He has had minimal wax buildup bilaterally.  TMs were intact.  Oropharynx was clear without erythema or exudate.  Sinuses were nontender.  Nostrils were patent.  Neck is supple Supple without JVD, lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes, rubs or rhonchi.  Heart regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  He has a small umbilical hernia that is not protruding and bowel sounds are active.  He has no organomegaly and there is no CVA tenderness.  Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  He does have significant thickening and brittleness of the toenails of both feet consistent with onychomycosis.  He has no open sores of the feet.  Neurologically, he is alert and oriented x3 and grossly nonfocal with intact distal sensation to light touch in both feet.  He has no generalized lymphadenopathy and his joint examination shows no effusions or erythema.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

1.  Annual physical, preventative maintenance.  The patient had a colonoscopy in 2125 and was told to come back in 2130 because of benign polyps.  I did recommend guaiac stool cards today for home testing purposes.  Immunizations are up-to-date.  He did receive an H1N1 and a seasonal flu vaccine through his employer and for private pharmacies.  His Pneumovax is due to be a booster in 2 years' time.  We are recommending a PSA and a DRE annually starting today.  Labs were also drawn in the office for CBC, CMP, and lipid profile.  The patient is declining Zostavax at this time.  We will recommend a followup in 1 year for an annual physical.

2.  Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.  The patient has now eliminated concentrated sweets from his diet, although I do suspect dietary noncompliance beyond table sugar.  Recommend checking a hemoglobin A1c today, urine for microalbumin, lipid panel and creatinine as well as a BUN and a GFR.  I would recommend continuing his insulin NPH 42 units daily, but we may need to recommend an endocrine consult if his A1c remains elevated despite dietary improvement.  We did recommend aggressive weight loss and exercise as this is a major impediment to his glucose control.  I would recommend follow up in 3 to 4 months.

3.  Obesity.  We will check a TSH, lipid panel and glucose to ensure that he is in good metabolic balance.  I do suspect continued poorly controlled diabetes given his past history.

4.  CAD with history of DVT.  He has had an ICD interrogated recently.  We will check a lipid panel today.  We would like to strive for an LDL less than 70 given his high risk status, I would recommend changing his steroid to a higher dose if required at that point.

HOLCOMB, DENNIS

83312060

07/28/2125





HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Dennis Holcomb is a lovely 57-year-old gentleman with a past medical history notable for coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction with known ventricular tachycardia with AICD in place.  He continues to work at Alaska Air and has multiple family obligations which are stressful to him.  He has had no exertional neck, chest, arm, or jaw pain.  He has not felt his AICD fire.  He has had no lightheadedness or weakness.  He continues on atenolol, aspirin, folate, furosemide, insulin, lisinopril, simvastatin and Viagra.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam today, his weight is 224, heart rate is 74 and blood pressure is 120/77.  There is no increase in jugular venous pressure.  Carotids are without bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout.  Cardiovascular exam is notable for nondisplaced PMI, S1, physiologically split S2 with systolic ejection murmur and a soft holosystolic apical murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, free of organomegaly and bruits.  Extremities are warm and free of edema with symmetric pulses, motor strength, and sensation.



LABORATORY DATA:  EKG is notable for sinus with evidence of prior inferior myocardial infarction.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  In summary, Dennis has been doing well with respect to his blood pressure control and exercise.  Given his current levels of stress, we are going to change his atenolol to 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night, and I have encouraged him to get to a target weight of 190 this year, and I am making no other changes in his medical regimen.

Physical Exam

BP     R 150/105  L  145/100		HR    	64	weight 327 lbs.

Today	UA     1.015/5.0/1+P. 

	Sed     one cast with dense pigmented inclusion (?cells),otherwise bland.



Impression and Plan

Mr Albert has progressive renal insufficiency, he does currently not require renal replacement therapy. Contributors may be Cyclosporine toxicity and intermittent dehydration. However, the recent more rapid rise makes biphosphonate toxicity or HCV-associated renal disease a worthy consideration. Bobbie also has uncontrolled hypertension and anemia.



I took the liberty to order a 24-hour urine collection, a kidney US, as well as SPEP, UPEP, cryoglobulin level, Fe-studies. Norvasc 5mg PO qd was also returned to his regiment. For now, I suggest to hold further infusions of Parmidronate until more data is available.



Bobbie will have a blood pressure check in 2 weeks (when he is in Nappanee for another appointment), and I will see him in four weeks. At that point he will be evaluated for Epogen/Aranesp.

CC: SOB, DOE x 5 days



HPI: This is a 73yo male w/ a complicated PMH that includes HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, and a past MI, which resulted in the placement of an AICD, who now p/w severe SOB and DOE.  Five days PTA, the Pt became SOB while walking up the stairs to his apartment on the 3rd floor.  He took a SL NG pill which he says alleviated the SOB and allowed him to continue.  Over the next few days, his SOB became progressively worse and occurred at rest.  His SOB would awaken him from his sleep, occurring 3-4x/ night.  He states that SL NG pills alleviated his PND.  The Pt sleeps on one pillow.  During the course of his worsening SOB, his exercise tolerance decreased from a baseline of walking 2.5 hours without any SOB to walking for 1.5 hours with multiple stops due to SOB.  These episodes of SOB were not associated w/ CP (pleuritic or otherwise), palpitations, F/C, N/V, diaphoresis, abdominal discomfort, or pain in his arms or jaw.  



Also during this time, the Pt noted progressive b/l swelling of his legs (from ankles to knees) and increasing abdominal girth.  He states that his legs would pit when he pressed on them.  The LE swelling were not associated w/ calf pain.  On the day before admission, however, he did develop a non-productive, dry cough.  On the DOA, his Sx had worsened to the point where he felt like he needed to be seen by a doctor.  He was subsequently driven to NYSH-East by his wife and son, where he was seen and then re-directed to NYSH.     



At NYSH-East, the Pt's vitals were: T 97.6 P 52-55 BP 167/77 O2Sat 98% Wt 188.5# w/ clothes.

The Pt received Lasix 40mg IV and O2 @ 3L/min.



At NYSH-Ed, the Pt's vitals were: P 48 BP 157/78 RR 20 O2Sat 99% on 2L

The Pt received ASA 325mg PO. 

Since receiving the Lasix, the Pt's LE edema has drastically diminished, and the Pt states that he feels a lot better.



The Pt has not experienced any recent weight loss and is on a regular diet without salt restriction (he uses salt 2-3x/wk).  He also claims that he is adherent to taking his meds.

EKG:   NSR, bradycardia (54bpm), LAE, TW-flattening in V5,V6. Biphasic TW in V2-V4. LVH by voltage criteria.  No difference from past EKGs.



CXR FINDINGS:

	Cardiac AICD projecting over the left hemithorax, unchanged. Lung fields are clear. 

Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Right sided diaphragmatic hernia, unchanged. Bony 

thorax is unchanged.



No evidence of active cardiopulmonary disease. 



Echo (6/93):  EF 60%, symmetric LVH



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 73yo male w/ a complicated PMH that includes HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, and a past MI, which resulted in the placement of an AICD, who now p/w SOB.

	

PE - This is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out.  Although, there were no 

CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs.  Consider D-dimer to rule out recent PE.   

	Ischemia  - EKG and the negative set of cardiac enzymes x2 does not suggest this. However, Pt 

has not had any acute Sx while on the floor. 

PNA - This is less likely given the lack of fever or elevated WBC.

Tumor - This is also less likely given the lack of weight loss, the acute nature of the symptoms, 

and the lacko f lymphadenopathy.



1)	SOB - Most likely CHF>PE/DVT>ischemia>>PNA,tumor; however, he currently appears asymptomatic. PE is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out, although there were no CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs, and the onset was not acute.  The Pt may have had an exertional ischemia but the lack of CP and EKGs changes makes this less likely; however, the Pt has been asymptomatic on the floor and so no EKG tracings concomitant with the SOB are available to completely rule out this possibility.  PNA and tumor are less likely given the lack of fevers and chills and any hx of weight loss.  



Will start the Pt on O2 in addition to his normal medicinal regimen of diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE-I.  Will consider the addition of spironolactone.  Order echo to determine EF and to identify structural myocardial changes if any.  Order LFT's to check for decreased perfusion to vital organs.  Monitor UOP for kidney functions.  Monitor EKG for any changes.  Will send for a D-dimer to r/o recent PE. 



2)	HTN - Poorly controlled, may be 2o to missing meds today. Will also be treated using meds for CHF.

3)	DM - Sugars elevated.  Will treat w/ his home medication of glucophage and glyburide.

4)	Hyperlipidemia - Stable. Cont home medication of Lipitor.

5)	FEN - Switch to low salt diet with no concentrated sweet.  Consider a diabetic diet as well.

6)	Dispo - Will d/c once Pt is stabilized.

12/10/94 Intern addendum:



Patient seen and examined with med student above.  Agree with overall assessment above.  Briefly:



This is a 73M with a hx of CAD s/p MI, s/p AICD, IDDM, HTN, and hyperlipidemia, who presents with DOE, PND and bilateral leg edema x4 days.  DOE is not associated with anginal symptoms including CP, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis, although the patient reports it is relieved by nitroglycerine.  Physical exam findings here are notable for a flat JVP, absence of crackles, 2/6 SEM at LLSB and apex, and mild, symmetric, pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.  Per chart notes, in clinic he was noted to have bulging neck veins.  



Favor CHF >?pacer malfunction, ischemia > PE.  CHF is a somewhat confusing picture as symptoms suggest L-sided failure with pulmonary edema while there is little objective data (no crackles on exam, CXR clear) to suggest this.  Prior to our evaluation he received 40 of IV Lasix and diuresed at least one liter (with subjective improvement), which may account for this discrepancy.  



Plan is for echo to evaluate his LV function, pacer interrogation, and stress.  D-dimer should be sufficient to pursue PE as this is a low-prob possibility.

			Reason for visit:

   Follow up of CAD s/p CABG adn multiple CV risk factors



			Interval History:

   A 74 yo man with a long history of CAD eventually necessitating CABG in 4/2161.  He has had several chest pain syndromes over the years but, as of late, has been doing quite well in that regard.

His last CV evaluation was an Adenosine PET in 4/63 which showed an EF 46 with anterior and anterolateral flow abnormalites.  These are consistent with his known occluded diagonal (also unbypassed).  His last cath in 6/62 showed patent vein grafts to his OM and to his RCA and a patent but atretic LIMA.  He has an occluded RCA, an 80% OM, and a 60% LAD in addition to the occluded diagonal (fills via OM collaterals).  

He was admitted to Fahey Center in May with syncope associated with bradycardia.  His atenolol was changed to coreg and he has had no difficulties since that time.  He does have a long-standing trifasicular block.

He denies any chest pain, orthopnea, PND, LEE, palpitations, or syncope since that admission.

Someone started him on Niaspan which has been associated with diffuse flushing, itching, and a burning sensation.

			Assessment and plan:

   A 74 yo man with multiple chest pain syndromes and CV risk factors associated with CAD and mild LV dysfunction.  His chest pain syndromes have resolved.  He has a long-standing trifasicular block and had what sounds like syncope a few months ago.  This was associated with bradycardia and has resolved with changing him to low dose coreg.

CV risk factor modification remains our primary focus.

Plan.

1. CAD-increase asa to 325 and take at night with niaspan in hopes of lessening side effects.  He needs an ARB, so will try again to get him to take diovan at 80 a day (I gave samples and a Rx).

2. LV dysfunction--we will check a GBPS for EF.

3. DM-followed by Dr. Orton.  Continue to aim for an A1c of 7.0

4. Carotid disease--this seems to be limited to the external carotid, so I don't think any intervention will be necessary.  Continue to Rx risk factors.

5. Lipids-look great today.  Continue as is, but given his past intolerance of and noncompliance with meds, I suspect he will give up the Niaspan soon!  We will try to give asa with it to help with the side effects.

6. HTN--home BPs have been higher too on coreg.  I am trying to get him on an ARB again.  Diovan at 80 a day. He will get f/u labs in one month

NAME:    Vines, Stephen
MRN:      1672569

Stephen comes in today.  He has been feeling pretty well.  Really has no new
complaints.  He still has 5 block claudication in his calves and he continues to smoke 
a half pack per day.  His neuropathy is stabilized and his sugars have been good for
the most part in the 140-150 range on insulin.  His weight has been stable.  He has
had no shortness of breath or chest pain and his review of systems is otherwise
negative.

HABITS: Smokes about a half pack per day.  Does not drink, not really getting much
exercise.  His legs hurt only when he walks over 5 blocks.  It doesn't hurt when he is
working in the McCormick Company.

PHYSICAL EXAM: He looks well.  His blood pressure is 142/80.  His pulse is 74
and regular.  Respirations are 16. Lungs are clear.  No worrisome skin lesions. No
bruits.  1+ carotids.  Abdomen is soft and nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly, no
pulsatile masses, no bruits. Decreased pulses in the feet and decreased capillary refill
and decreased sensation of vibration and fine touch.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  

(1)  Diabetes.  Will check his hemoglobin A1c to see where we stand.  Continue
     on his current regimen.  Encouraged him to increase his exercise and watch his
     diet.  He has an eye exam scheduled.  His feet look okay, though we will have
     to be careful given his neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease.

(2)  Claudication.  Once again, talked to Mr. Vines about the absolute
     importance of quitting smoking.  He is going to try using the Wellbutrin.  Gave
     him a prescription for #60.  He will take one a day for 3-4 days and then go
     up to 1 p.o. b.i.d.  He has no contraindications. I also encouraged him to use
     the patch.  Hopefully, we will be able to get him off the cigarettes.  I also
     encouraged him to walk until it hurts at least 3-4 x a day to try and train his
     legs.

(3)  Hypertension.  Our goal is to get his blood pressure down about 130.  Will
     increase the Mavik to twice a day.

(4)  Hyperlipidemia.  Well controlled on Lipitor.  Recheck his lipids.

(5)  Neuropathy.  Stable.  He doesn't feel the need for any medication for it.

(6)  HPDP.  Will check his guaiac cards.  He is not interested in a sigmoidoscopy. 
     He has had a Pneumovax.  Patient will follow up with me in 3 months.

Interim History:	

Comes to review diabetes and related problems.

He had L THR in April

Has gained some weight since the surgery.

However, he reports that his BS are erratic despite a good diet and good appetite. He has had some symptoms of hypoglycemia in the late morning. He has checked his BS at that time and has found BS in the 70's-90's. 

Home Blood Tests:  

B 	87-140's, and occasionally in the 200's, which he attributes to    bad food    the previous evening. 

Retinopathy:	He has seen Dr. Dailey within a month or so. Again going next week. He has had a Bell's palsy by report. It has improved very significant ly. 

Nephropathy:	Due for microalbumin/creatinine ratio; normal in past.

Neuropathy:	No foot discomfort.

Cardiac:	No chest pain. No unusual dyspnea on exertion though he does have stable dyspnea on exertion doing activities in the house. 

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Medications: He is on more insulin than he was prior to his hip surgery.



Social History: 

He is planning to return to work as a printing press operator. He thinks that he can handle it and gets to sit down a lot.

His wife has been having problems with what he thinks to be complications of radiation therapy for gynecologic cancer.



Review of Systems: above



Physical Exam:	

He walks with a cane. Looks pretty frail but his mind is alert.

BP:   140/64		P:   68, regular	

Wt:   164 without shoes, up 15 since March

HEENT:	Anicteric. 

Carotids:	Normal pulses, without bruits

Neck:	No JVD

Chest:	Clear to auscultation

Heart:	Normal S1; ? paradoxical S2.  S4.  2/6 systolic ejection murmur

Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness. No palpable AAA. 

Extremities:	Trace ankle edema.        DP trace R, 1+ L. PT absent R, 1+ L.    There is a heel ulcer of L but the crust appears to be separating leaving healthy skin underneath.

Neurological:	AJ absent. Vibration sense moderately-severely reduced at the great toes. 



Impressions and Plan:	

Test BS QID a couple of days per week rather than every morning.

Reduce the NPH to 15 U and try to keep diet pretty uniform.

Call Ann Vandenberg if having any symptoms of hypoglycemia or BS<90.

Bring the heel ulcer to Dr. Chandler's attention when he sees him next week.

Be sure that he gets a flu shot.

The patient was seen with the medical resident.  This is a brief 

addendum to the chart.  I have discussed management with the 

internal medicine resident who saw the patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Briefly, this is a gentleman who 

is status post lung surgery who complains of feeling weak, with 

mild shortness of breath and fevers over the last couple of days.  

He has noted some drainage and redness of his surgical site on the 

left side.  He has had no headache, chest pain, abdominal pain.  He 

has had mildly loose stools and felt weak and somewhat 

light-headed.  His wife reports that he had been confused overnight 

after taking his medications.  The patient states that this 

happened last night and has now resolved.

TEAM 2 ACCEPT NOTE

Patient's name: Frank Keatering	
MRN: 	4832978
Date of Admission to MICU: 	12/11/95
Date of transfer to Internal Medicine: 	12/13/95

ID/CC:  acute loss of motor/sensation at level of T8

History Obtained From: Pt, old charts, transfer note.

History of Present Illness:  74 y/o man with h/o paraplegia 2/2 compression fracture and wheelchair bound, vascular dz, with recent bilateral ileofemoral and renal artery stent (11/24/95) and recent cardiac cath stent to the circumflex (11/28/95). Pt presented to OSH 12/10 with c/o abdominal pain onset the PM prior to admission, diffuse in nature, localized in the mid-epigastric region, RUQ, and LUQ with a pain scale of 8-10/10 pain. Per charts he reported decreased pain in the am with ability to tolerate PO's and then increasing pain that afternoon. Also associated with diaphoresis, + nausea, no vomiting, no sob. During placement of a central line at OSH ED, pt experienced shaking during procedure and had acute loss of motor and sensory strength in the LE's. Per Nursing chart at OSH ED, pt given Morphine for abd pain (around 4p-8p) with coffee ground emesis at 8pm with subsequent decrease in BP to 76/49 and started on dopamine for pressure support. At the same time, pt c/o numbness in feet. Per charts he was reported to be bending forward coughing and vomiting and experienced acute loss of sensation/motor function in the abdomen and lower extremities.

Course at the outside hospital- 
1.Neuro- acute loss of sensation/motor at the level of T8. Per Neurology, had paraplegic legs, no sphincter tone, no anal wink, Sx were concerning for aortic dissection. Abd US unrevealing but was reported as a poor study. CT of T8-T10 did not show gross deviations of spine, no soft tissue masses or disk bulging.  
2.GI- Coffee ground emesis at OSH, with no fresh blood- with dropping HCT 44-40-35 and transfused 1 U pRBC on 12/11.  Also guiac +.  Etiology thought to be 2/2 ASA and plavix.  No egd was performed and amlyase and lipase, and LFTs were nl per report.  
3.ID- Pt was hypotensive with SBP in the 70's on presentation with good response to fluids, In setting of elevated WBC to 22 pt was empirically treated with Abx (zosyn, flagyl and vanc). BCx were sent and CXR appeared clear.
4.CARDIAC- Cardiac enzymes were followed with increasing Troponins: 0.04    0.07    0.08    0.09, CK index: 3.0    3.7. No complaints of chest pain during his stay. And no report of signifigant EKG changes. 
5.Renal- Creatinine increase from 2.6 to 3.1 thought to be 2/2 Acute on chronic RF.

Pt transferred to HOB for further eval of r/o dissection, r/o cord compression, GIB, poss abd ischemia, ARI/CRI

Review of System on admission: 
CV: no orthopnea, no PND
Resp: sob, no cough, no sputum production 
GI: abdominal pain as above, no melena, no BRBPR, able to have BM
GU: per OSH ED report of dark urine in ileostomy bag x2d with decreased UOP
Musculoskeletal: baseline decreased to minimal movement in the LLE, min-mod movement in right leg, able to transfer to and from wheelchair
Neuro/Psych: alert and oriented x3.

MICU Course:
1.Paraplegia:  Has baseline deficits (wheelchair bound), but unclear how they compare to current exam--> level at T5/T6.  
- first MRI showed low T2 signal collections from T6--> L1 with displacement of thoracic cord anteriorly from T7-T10. 
-no cord compression on repeat study, however ddx still includes cord infarction vs demyelinating disease
-neurosurg, neuro consulted, following
2.Respiratory status: Acute desaturation 2/2 methemoglobinemia as consequence of topical anesthetic
- s/p methylene blue (80 mg x 1, 40 mg x 1) with resolution of methemoglobin from 35% to 1%. 
3.Renal failure:  Possibilities raised include cholesterol emboli from recent interventions, relative hypoperfusion with normalization of blood pressure. 
- urine eos negative
- Cr 2.9-->2.5 today
4.Abdominal pain: mild-moderate stenosis just beyond origin of SMA seen on MRA; considered mesenteric ischemia a/w low flow state. However, lactic acid 1.3, and pH wnl 
- have liberalized bp parameters now that dissection ruled out
5.GI bleed: coffee ground emesis-- unclear if this reflects enteric ischemia vs. sentinel bleeding
-GI team consulted
6.Coronary artery disease:
- troponin 0.14 on admission, but subsequently all wnl, likely troponin leak in setting of GIB prior to admission
- taken off ASA, plavix in context of suspected UGIB
- cont lopressor 
- hydral, isordil, goal SBP 140-150
7.Hemodynamics:
- TEE with no dissection
- TTE with EF 54%, no SWMA, no tamponade
- metoprolol +/- isordil/hydral
8.Diabetes mellitus
- on MICU insulin protocol, will switch to sliding scale

MICRO: Urine, blood cx x 2 NGTD at HOB; VRE neg x1; MRSA nasal swab neg x1

EKG: NSR at 80, nl axis, old ST depressions in V4-5

CXR (12/13):  Stable chest without new or enlarging infiltrates or pneumonias.
	Cardiac size normal, no signs of edema or decompensation.
	Operative changes as before and right subclavian central line as
	before without apparent pneumothorax or complication.

MRI (12/12): 
EXAMINATION: MRI of the cervical, thoracic, lumbar spine.
	EXAMINATION DATE: 12/12/95.
	Comparison films: The prior films are available for comparison to
	due PACS technical difficulties. Comparison is made with the
	report of prior C-spine CT from January 2095.
	History:72 year old man with history of paraplegia from traumatic
	injury in 2066 with new sensation loss and motor loss below T8.
	Technique:Sagittal T2 images were obtained of the cervical,
	thoracic, lumbar spine.  The Axial T2 images are obtained from T10
	through L1. The images are moderately motion degraded in the
	thoracic and lumbar spine.  The cervical spine MRI was repeated
	three times due to motion. No contrast was used.
	Findings:
	CERVICAL SPINE:
	Straightening of the cervical lordosis is noted from C2 through
	C6. Bone marrow signal demonstrates patchy areas of T2 high signal
	within the C4 and C5 vertebral body.  Posterior disc osteophyte
	complexes are present at C2/C3, C3/C4, C4/C5, C5/C6, C6/C7.
	The patient is status post posterior laminectomy and fusion which
	causes susceptibility artifact. The laminectomy from C3 through
	C7, previously noted, is not well visualized due to motion
	artifact and susceptibility.
	THORACIC SPINE:
	There is partial fusion of T4 to T5 with loss of height of T4 and
	focal kyphosis at this area. Myelomalacia is noted from T1 through
	T5. There is focal T2 high signal within the cord substance at the
	T4 level.
	T2 low signal collections are noted posterior to the cord at T6
	through T12.  A high signal septation is present through this
	collection at T7 and extending from T11 through L1. This low T2
	signal collection displaces the cord anteriorly from T7 through
	T10.
	The cord is small from T7 through T10 consistent with myelomalacia
	and high T2 signal.
	High signal is also present in the cord substance of the distal
	thoracic cord and at the conus.
	Small amount of T2 high signal is noted in encircling the distal
	thoracic cord and the spinal roots.
	LUMBAR SPINE:
	Straightening of the lumbar spine is noted with grade 1
	retrolisthesis of L4 on L5. There is a levoscoliosis with apex at
	L4/L5.
	Disc demonstrates T2 shortening within several lumbar discs and
	disc height loss at L4/L5, L5/S1.
	T2 high signal at the endplates are noted around the L4/L5 and
	L5/S1 disc levels.   Moderate to severe stenosis of the bilateral
	neural foramen at L5/S1 facet osteoarthritis and disc height loss
	of L5/S1 is noted. The patient has had prior surgery of the
	spinous processes of L4 and L5.
	The conus terminates at L1/L2. The spinal roots appear clumped
	centrally and there is T2 high signal around the upper spinal
	roots. T2 high signal is noted at the distal aspect of the thecal
	sac.
IMPRESSION:
	 1.  Low T2 signal collections from T6 through L1 with
	displacement of the thoracic cord anteriorly from T7 through T10.
	The differential diagnosis for this collection includes unusual
	flow artifact or multiloculated septations or epidural
	collections.  Recommend dedicated thoracic and lumbar spine MRI
	with contrast and T2 axials through the L spine and C spine. If
	clinically indicated, consider repeat C spine MRI with contrast.
	Dr. Winters was informed of this at 2:15 PM on 12/12/95.
	2.  Myelomalacia of the thoracic cord from T4-T5 level and at
	T7-10.
	3.  The spinal roots are incompletely imaged but have a clumped in
	appearance suggesting arachnoiditis. Repeat axial images through
	the entire spinal roots could better evaluate this.
	4. Degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine at L4/L5 and
	L5/S1. degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine at C3/C4
	C4/C5 C5/C6.
	5.  Prior surgical fusion of the cervical spine and laminectomies
	are incompletely evaluated on the study due to motion.  Please see
	prior CT report for the details.
	6.  Mild focal kyphosis with height loss at T4 appears subacute
	and may be from prior trauma.

MRI (12/13):	
MRI THORACIC AND LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM
	History: History of previous cord compression. Status post recent
	aorto-bifemoral bypass. Now with sudden onset of loss of lower
	extremity motor function and sensation.
	Comparison: MRI spine dated 12/12/95.
	Procedure: Multiplanar MR imaging of the entire spine was
	performed without and with Gadolinium.
	Findings:
	There is an old compression fracture at T5.  There is exaggeration
	of the normal kyphosis at this level.  There is no evidence of
	marrow edema to suggest acute fracture in the spine.  There is
	straightening of the normal lumbar lordosis.  There is grade 1
	retrolisthesis of L4 on L5.  There is degenerative change in the
	L4-5 and L5-S1 end plates.  There is increased T2 signal in the
	L4-5 and L5-S1 discs however the adjacent endplates are well
	preserved, and although infection cannot be completely excluded,
	it is considered very unlikely.  There is a small central disc
	protrusion at T8-9.
	There is no evidence of significant canal stenosis in the thoracic
	or lumbar spine.
	Examination of the cord demonstrates myelomalacia extending from
	the T5 level inferiorly.  There is prominent flow artifact in the
	CSF surrounding the myelomalacic cord.  The conus is expanded and
	demonstrates hyperintensity on T2 weighted sequences.  There is no
	associated enhancement.  No vascular flow voids are identified.
	There is a small right pleural effusion.  There is consolidation
	at the right lung base.  This may represent atelectasis or
	infiltrate and correlation with chest x-ray is recommended.
IMPRESSION:
	Expansion and signal abnormality in the conus superimposed on
	chronic myelomalacia. The differential diagnosis includes cord
	infarction, and demyelinating disease.  Vascular malformation and
	neoplasm are considered less likely due to the absence of vascular
	flow voids and abnormal enhancement.


MRA:  MRA of the aorta with runoff was conducted as per departmental
	protocol.
	FINDINGS:
	Due to the nature of MRI imaging, dedicated sequences were
	performed to evaluate the vasculature. The remainder of the
	abdominal organs are not fully evaluated and if clinically
	indicated, directed sequences could be performed.
	This was a technically limited study due to suboptimal contrast
	bolus and movement.  The patient was agitated and unable to
	cooperate .
	No evidence for an aortic dissection is identified.
	There is moderate stenosis of the left subclavian artery just
	beyond its origin.
	The celiac trunk is patent.
	There is mild/moderate stenosis just beyond the origin of the
	superior mesenteric artery.
	The renal arteries cannot be assessed on this study.
IMPRESSION:
	1.  Limited study due to technical factors and patient movement
	however no evidence of an aortic dissection is identified.  A
	repeat MRI with better contrast bolus and sedation may be obtained
	if clinically indicated.
	2.  Moderate stenosis is noted just distal to the origin of the
	left subclavian artery.
3.	Mild/moderate stenosis just beyond the origin of the SMA.

CT Spine (12/13): report pending
_____________________________________________________________________
Assessment/Plan: 74 y/o vasculopath presenting with new neurological deficits, abdominal pain, UGI bleed, progressive renal failure, initially worrisome for aortic dissection. Unifying diagnosis remains obscure- ? occlusive atheroemboli vs epidural hematoma.

1.Paraplegia: Has baseline deficits (wheelchair bound), but unclear how they compare to current exam--> level at T5/T6. First MRI showed low T2 signal collections from T6--> L1 with displacement of thoracic cord anteriorly from T7-T10; no cord compression on repeat study, however ddx still includes cord infarction vs demyelinating disease
-neurology and neurosurgery following
-awaiting spinal CT to evaluate for epidural hematoma
-in addition, neurology has asked for MRI with line diffusion and MPGR sequence to r/o infarction, which has been ordered

2.Respiratory status: Acute desaturation 2/2 methemoglobinemia as consequence of topical anesthetic; s/p methylene blue (80 mg x 1, 40 mg x 1) with resolution of methemoglobin from 35% to 1%, now on 4L NC sats are 95%.
-cont O2 and wean as tolerated
-enter hurricane spray as allergy

3.Renal failure:  Possibilities raised include cholesterol emboli from recent interventions, relative hypoperfusion with normalization of blood pressure. No contrast at OSH; urine eos negative; FENa= 0.94%; Cr 3.1    2.5 today

Record date: 2086-08-02

This is my first visit with Ms. Ordonez, for whom this is a routine physical.



68 yo pleasant white woman with the following problems:



1.  Left vertebral stenosis

Ms. Ordonez presented with ataxia and dizziness in 2083 and was found to have an infarct in the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery.  Work-up revealed left vertebral stenosis.  She recovered after the event to her baseline, and now has no complaints of HA, dizziness, ataxia, paresthesias, or motor weakness.  She is chronically anticoagulated and followed in coumadin clinic; recent INR was 2.6.



2.  Hypertension

During her 2083 admission for CVA, Ms. Ordonez was found to be severely hypertensive.  She is now on Atenolol 75 mg po qd and Zestril 10 mg po qd for control of her hypertension.  She does not measure her blood pressure at home.  



3.  Diabetes mellitus

Ms. Ordonez has NIDDM for which she takes Micronase 5 mg BID with fairly good control.  She has no known history of retinopathy, nephropathy, CAD, or neuropathy.  She has no complaints of visual changes, chest pain/SOB, paresthesias, or bloating/early satiety.  She has noticed some increase in thirst (7 glasses of water/day) which she attributes to the heat and she has nocturia (2x per night) which has been stable over a couple of years.  



4.  Dyslipidemia  

Ms. Ordonez has a history of elevated total cholesterol; I don't think she has had a fasting lipid panel.



5.  Benign breast disease

Ms. Ordonez has diffusely fibronodular breasts.  Microcalcifications were noted on mammography and bilateral excisional biopsies revealed benign fibroadenoma without evidence of malignancy.  Mammography on 7/28/86 was normal.  



6.  Skin lesion

Ms. Ordonez has a skin lesion on her right temple which has developed over the course of a couple of months.  It is slightly sore to touch, and is non-pruritic and does not bleed.



ROS:  No HA, dizziness, ataxia, hearing loss, vision changes, chest pain/pressure, SOB, leg swelling, PND/orthopnea, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, dysuria, incontinence, paresthesias, arthralgias, rash, fevers, cold or heat intolerance.  Does complain of mild chronic dry cough.



Health maintenance:  

No ASA (on Coumadin)

No recent pneumovax/influenza

No tetanus vaccine within 10 yrs

Does not do regular breast exams, mammography 7/28/86

No recent stool guaiac, has never had endoscopy

Has never had pap smear

EXT:  Trace LE edema to ankles, no cyanosis or clubbing

SKIN:  Keratotic 1 cm lesion on R temple

NEURO:  PERRL, CN II-VIII and XII tested and intact, motor strength 5/5 throughout, light touch sensation intact in distal extremities, finger-nose and heel/shin testing intact

RECTAL/GU:  deferred



Tests:

UA negative (including protein)

Fasting lipid panel, CBC, Chem 7, HbA1C pending



Impression by problem:



1.  Left vertebral stenosis:  Patient has not had recurrent symptoms since her CVA in 2083 and she is neurologically intact by my neuro exam.  She is therapeutic on her coumadin.  She will continue coumadin and I will attempt to address CVA risk factors such as HTN and dyslipidemia (will avoid lowering BP excessively to preserve vertebral perfusion).



2.  Hypertension:  Patient is quite hypertensive (170/90) on current regimen of Atenolol 75 mg qd and Zestril 10 mg qd.  Her heart rate is 74; I will increase her Atenolol to 100 mg qd.  She does not complain of any side effects from her medications.  She does have a chronic, mild dry cough which is possibly related to her Zestril.  



3.  Diabetes Mellitus

Ms. Ordonez takes Micronase 5 mg BID for blood sugar control; she does not measure her glucose at home.  She has had a little polydipsia/polyuria.  Today I will check a glucose and HbA1c level.  Her UA today is negative and I will check a spot urine microalbumin/Cr ratio.  On her next visit I will schedule an ophthalmology appointment.  She is on an ACE inhibitor.



4.  Dyslipidemia

The patient has had a recent cholesterol of 206.  I will obtain a fasting lipid panel.



5.  Benign breast disease

Excisional biopsy showed benign fibroadenoma, mammography on 7/28/86 was normal.  She has diffuse fibronodular disease on exam today.  I have instructed her in self-examination.



6.  Skin lesion

Ms. Ordonez' skin lesion looks like it may be a suborrheic keratosis or squamous cell.  I will refer to a dermatologist.



7.  Health maintenance

I discussed both hormone replacement therapy and screening flexible sigmoidoscopy with Ms. Ordonez and she has declined both.  She also does not want a pneumovax today, although she is willing to have her tetanus.  She has also agreed to start taking calcium/vitamin D as well as an MVI.  She has had recent mammography.



Follow-up:  I will see Ms. Ordonez in one month to check her blood pressure on her increased dose of Atenolol.

INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES

CAPE CORAL HOSPITAL



Personal data and overall health   The patient is a 53-year-old white male, who presents for followup of multiple medical problems.



Major Problems

Diabetes mellitus

Very noncompliant for many years.  Previously had blood sugars as high as 400 to 600 and would not take any medications.  Diabetes complicated by peripheral neuropathy, which is severe; gastroparesis, which has been severe; recurrent skin abscesses; and probable coronary artery disease.

Hypertension

This has been also severe for many years and noncompliance is a significant issue.  Now complicated also by significant orthostatic hypotension presumably on the basis of autonomic insufficiency.

Coronary artery disease

He is status post recent non Q wave MI with elevated troponins presenting with congestive heart failure and chest pain in the setting of an elevated creatinine.

Chronic renal insufficiency

Creatinine approximately 3.

Pyelonephritis HISTORY OF



Anemia

Chronic.    Extensive workup negative.

Sinus tachycardia

Chronic.  This has been present for many years.  Etiology unclear.  Recent stress test does not show evidence of more complicated arrhythmia.  Cardiac ultrasound was done on his recent admission, and he has an ejection fraction of 63% with no significant valvular disease.  He has symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.

Migraine headache HISTORY OF



Hepatitis C

Chronic.



Allergies

No known allergies   



Change in therapies and Renewals

senna 2 teaspoons  BID

aspirin 325 mg  qd

hydralazine 25 mg  TID

Imdur 30 mg  QD

Lasix 20 mg  qd

Nexium 20 mg  qd

Norvasc 5 mg  BID

Neurontin 100 mg  TID

labetalol HCl 100 mg  BID

losartan 25 mg  qd

erythromycin 250 mg  TID

Epogen 3000 units sq qwk

Colace 100 mg  BID



Family history   Notable for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.



Social history   He was previously the head statistical programmer for electronic data systems for many years and now disabled.  He is married and has a daughter.  Cigarettes, none times years.  Alcohol, previously heavy.  There was a history of previous illicit drug use.



Review of systems   Since he has been home, he has done reasonably well though he has noted increasing leg edema bilaterally with a significant weight gain.  He denies chest pain or palpitations.  He denies shortness of breath.  He has not been vomiting, and he actually self-discontinued both OxyContin and methadone because he felt that they did not make him feel well.



Physical examination

Pulse   86 per minute

Blood pressure 150/90    Today, 150/90 then 144/86

Weight   185 pounds

Heent   Eyes, ears, nose, and pharynx are normal, but dentition is poor

Neck   No bruits

Nodes   None palpable

Chest   Lungs, clear

Cor   Regular rate and rhythm without murmur

Abdomen   Benign

Extrem   With 3+ massive edema

Neuro   Abnormal gait due to peripheral neuropathy



Assessment and plan   Leg edema is uncertainly due to his vasodilators.  We will discontinue hydralazine and Norvasc.  He has already stopped his OxyContin and methadone.  We will see him back in approximately two weeks to follow up on his blood pressure.  He will have routine laboratory studies done today.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient has a known history of
hypopituitarism and hypertension who comes in today for routine
annual exam.  He states that he has been feeling exceptionally
well.  No history of chest pain, angina, dyspnea on exertion,
shortness of breath, abdominal complaints.  No difficulties in
bowel habits, melena, BRBPR.  No prostatic symptoms of urinary
hesitancy or slow stream.  He states that he has been carefully
taking his prednisone and testosterone as prescribed, as well as
his blood pressure medicines including lisinopril 40 q.d.,
atenolol 75 q.d., and his cholesterol medicine 10 of Lipitor q.d.
 He is no longer taking the hydrochlorothiazide that was
prescribed to him in the past.  He also states that he has run
out of Synthroid and has not been taking that for the past
several weeks.

The patient states that he is staying active, getting some
exercise, continues to abstain from smoking or drinking, and has
an appropriate diet.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On full review of systems, he denies any
current concerns except for occasional difficulty maintaining an
erection, which he states is not a significant problem for him.

MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor 10 q.d., testosterone q.3. weeks,
prednisone 5 mg q.a.m. 2.5 mg q.p.m., lisinopril 40 mg q.d., and 
atenolol 75 mg q.d.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Panhypopituitarism secondary to
macroadenoma resection and hypertension.

HEALTH MAINTENANCE:  Last cholesterol level 06/2077, total 171
with an HDL of 57 and LDL of 86.  The patient has not had a prior
colonoscopy.  Last PSA was less than assay 1 year ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Well appearing, in no acute distress. 
Blood pressure elevated at 170/84, heart rate 60.  HEENT:  Pupils
equal, round, reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are
intact.  Fundi are benign.  Oropharynx is clear.  Tympanic
membranes are clear.  Neck:  Shows no lymphadenopathy, no
thyromegaly.  He does have a 3 x 3 cm cyst on his posterior neck
that seems to be a lipoma.  JVP is flat.  Carotids are 2+ without
bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac: 
Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2 normal, positive S4, 1/6 systolic
murmur at the apex.  Abdomen:  Midline scar status post some type
of cord resection.  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Aorta is nonpalpable. 
There are no renal bruits.  Femoral arteries are without bruits. 
GU:  Testicles appear normal.  Penis appears normal.  Rectal: 
Guaiac negative brown stool.  Prostate is smooth and nonenlarged.
 Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Normal sensation
to vibratory in the feet.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a very pleasant 77-year-old
man who is overall doing extremely well except for his
hypertension which is poorly controlled.  I am unclear as to why
he stopped his hydrochlorothiazide, but I think that this should
be restarted as we do not have any further room with his
lisinopril or atenolol.  He will begin at 25 mg q.d.  I will have
his electrolytes checked today and come back and see me in 2
weeks' time for a repeat electrolyte check as well as blood
pressure check, and further medication adjustment if necessary. 
We will also check urinalysis for protein as well as an EKG at
this time given his hypertension.

Hyperlipidemia, on Lipitor.  We will recheck cholesterol today.

Panhypopituitarism.  He seems to be doing well on his medications
except that he stopped his TSH dose for unclear reasons.  I have
instructed him to restart his Synthroid and given him new
prescriptions.  We will recheck thyroid panel at this time.

Health maintenance.  We will check a PSA and schedule a
colonoscopy today.

He will return to clinic in 2 weeks' time for a BP check.

Eva  Newby M.D. 
Valley County Hospital

,  

Dear Dr. Newby:

  I was happy to see Michelle Klein (2474410: DOB August 6, 2075) who comes along with her husband, Nathaniel, for follow up cardiac evaluation. Michelle has been stable from a cardiac point of view. She has coronary artery disease and underwent LAD stent placement in 2148. She had negative stress sestamibi study in November 2151. She has been free of angina or cardiac-related symptoms. She notes occasional orthostatic dizziness. Her prior stamina symptoms have improved greatly. She has well-controlled hypertension on stable medical regimen. Her recent diagnosis of myelofibrosis has been followed through closely by her hematology group here at Valley County and we have discussed this at length. Michelle feels far better than at her last several visits and I am very happy to see this.

On clinical exam, blood pressure right arm is 130/80 mmHg, pulses are equal, normal and all well felt. First heart sound is normal to soft. Second is normal. There is a 1+/6 systolic apical murmur. No diastolic murmurs are present. No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. Thyroid is postoperative and stable. Neck veins are flat. Carotid upstrokes are normal. Lungs are clear. Abdominal exam is normal. I do not feel enlargement of the abdominal aorta.

The electrocardiogram is unchanged. It continues to show minimal nonspecific ST flattening and left atrial prominence.

Medications: Michelle no longer takes the verapamil, atenolol 50 mg per day, Lipitor 10 mg per day, Diovan 40 mg daily, Protonix 40 mg b.i.d., Synthroid 1.12 mg per day, vitamin B12 500 mg, B6 100 mg, magnesium 400 mg per day, and D3 2000 IU per day.

If there are any questions at anytime, please call me. I am happy to see Michelle 's spirits are good and that she is feeling better and actually, her clinical exam seems excellent as well. She does not manifest tachycardia. I note that her hematocrit is 31%.  Visit duration 40 min.-half in discussion re he cardiac and hematologic issues.

Best regards.

Sincerely yours,

	
Tony Wilkinson, MD

A/P: 76 RH F with prior CVA with minimal dysarthria at baseline HTN, HL, here with sx most consistent with idiopathic Bells palsy of the L. face given lower motor neuron distribution of her findings. Other considerations include recrudescence of her prior CVA sx, vs. HTN urgency/emergency.



Plan:

MRI/A of the brain with susceptibility to r/o CVA

BP control goal SBP &lt; 160 mm Hg

If negative for CVA, dx likely idiopathic bells which is a clinical dx. 

If above etiologies CVA, HTn related recrudescence of CVA sx negative, would favor initiating impiric tx for idiopathic bells with steroids and valacyclovir

May continue to follow up with PCP

If sx do not improve after trial of tx for Bells, then call Internal Medicine for appt. 415-726-3969

HPI: This is a 60 yo F w/a hx of fibromyalgia, Raynaud's, GERD, HTN, bronchiectasis and recurrent PNA who developed severe pain, swelling and stiffness in the MCP joints of both hands 2 nights ago. She says there was initially some redness, no warmth in these joints. She could not open or close her hands. She says the pain migrated to involve all of the joints in her hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders and knees. She noticed swelling in her R knee, no swelling or redness in other joints. Her muscles are diffusely tender. She recalls similar muscle discomfort in prior episodes attributed to fibromyalgia, although not as severe. She also remembers shoulder and elbow pain of similar but less intense character in 2128 while taking rifampin/cipro/azithro for MAC. These symptoms resolved when drugs were stopped. She denies recent fevers or chills. She completed an 8 day course of augmentin for MSSA PNA two days ago. Symptomatically she feels her PNA has resolved and she is at her baseline from a respiratory standpoint w/stable cough and SOB. She does report some mild L-sided pleuritic CP since yesterday. She denies weight loss, skin changes, rash, change in BMs, N/V, dry mouth, change in vision, weakness, paresthesias. ROS + for brittle nails, eye dryness not bothersome. FH notable for mother w/scleroderma.



Her symptoms did not respond to Excedrin and she presented to the ER 11/12. Exam notable for BP 212/93, HR 125, T 98, SO2 98%,    tenderness w/movement in UE's, R knee   . WBC 11.7, HCT 39.8, PLT 421, chem. 10 wnl, CXR w/stable bibasilar lung nodularity. She was admitted to Internal Medicine for further evaluation. She reports decreased pain with Demerol, interval improvement in hand joint swelling/erythema/stiffness.

Impr:	60 yo F w/longstanding fibromyalgia and bronchiectasis s/p recent MSSA PNA p/w diffuse arthralgias, myalgias and pleuritic CP. The constellation of myalgias, arthralgias/synovitis, ?pleurisy, Raynaud's, GERD, HTN and +FH invoke the possibility of scleroderma. Rarely, a variant of this disease can present without skin manifestations (systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma). The transient nature of her joint symptomatology is c/w possible crystal disease. The bilateral hand distribution is typical, but progression to involve other joints such as the knee is not. Postviral arthralgias/myalgias is another consideration given the quick resolution of the process. Her myalgias may well represent underlying fibromyalgia. We recommend

  	If available, past ANA, RF, ESR

  	Please check ANA, RF, parvovirus IgM and IgG, uric acid level, U/A

Reason for consult: Acute on chronic renal failure


HPI: 65 y/o man with PMH of stage IV CKD, HTN, CAD, RAS, DM, who was admitted to the CCU on 1/26 after an episode of bradycardia and PEA arrest at home.  Pt was found by his wife yesterday to be complaining of severe chest pain and SOB.  She called EMS.  Upon arrival of EMS, pt was in respiratory distress and bradycardic with a HR in the 20s.  He was intubated.  He subsequently became puloseless and asystolic and was coded for about 10 minutes with 3 rounds of epinephrine and atropine before he regained his pulse.  In the ED, his BP was 230/120 and he was started on a nitro gtt.  He was noted to have blood in his OG tube.  CXR showed bilateral patchy infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema.  Chest CT showed multiple rib fractures with substernal hematoma and bilateral modest pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis vs consolidations.


On admission, pt&#8217;s BUN and creatinine were 43 and 4.35, respectively.  He was started on a lasix gtt for diuresis without a good response.  His Cr started to rise: 4.6 &#224; 4.9 &#224; 5.4 &#224; 5.33 &#224; 6.3 &#224; 7.0.  His urine output continued to be poor, and renal consult was called.

Cardiology Admission Note
Christopher Powell
# 070 27 68

5/20/94 at 11:30 am

Mr Powell is admitted to Cardiology clinic s/p cath and PTCA/stent (2.25 x 12 Taxus) to the LAD

	
History of Present Illness

This 69 yo gentleman has a hx of CAD dating back several years. He underwent CABG x 3 in 2092 at WMMC after being diagnosed with CAD after presenting with symptoms of jaw pain and SOB. Immediately after surgery he was told there was likely a problem with one of the grafts. He began to have symptoms of jaw pain and dypnea within a few weeks of surgery and presented to Beloit State where he had cath within 6 weeks of CABG- at that time his LAD graft was down and his distal LAD was stenosed. Failed attempt to stent the distal LAD, but it was PTCA'd with no real relief of his symptoms. Last year, he presented here with further progression of his anginal equivalent and underwent cath which showed further stenosis of the distal LAD. There was no PCI option available. 

He has been aggressively managed with medications and initially his jaw pain improved, but the dyspnea has persisted. Unfortunately the jaw pain has reoccurred and he has become more symptomatic. He now presented for cath. 

Today he arrived via SDA for cath that showed his native disease to be severe with a 70% stenosis involving the ostium of the first diagonal branch. The mid-distal LAD is small and tapering with diffuse disease  up to 80%. The first diagonal has a high grade ostial stenosis. LCX has 40-50% stenosis proximal to the first OM. RCA has 80% stenosis proximally with competitive flow from the SVG. The LIMA-&gt; D1 is patent and the SVG-&gt; RCA is patent. The SVG-&gt; LAD is not visualized. The mid-LAD lesion was treated with PTCA/stenting with a 2.25 x 12 mm Taxus stent. He arrived on floor 5 pain free and in no distress.

Plan:

	
1. Cardiac: HR/BP well controlled. Continue current meds. Full dose ASA and plavix indefinitely. Stop PPI on plavix with new DES. Recently increase lipitor to 40 mg QD- will check fasting lipids in am along with LFT's. Adjust dose further as needed. Remove sheath once PTT normalizes. Ambulate once activity restrictions lifted. 

Continue nitrates for now given intramyocardial vessel and severe native distal LAD disease. Increase activity post DC as tolerated.. 

2. Endo: Diabetic on glyburide- continue for now. Check FS BID- insulin scale as needed. 

3. GI: on protonix- will change to zantac while on plavix to prevent drug interaction with PPI's/plavix. Guaiac all stools

4. Psych: anxiety/depression- continue lexapro

ADMISSION NOTE



CC/ID: 51 yo F with no known h/o CHF or CAD, but with multiple cardiac risk factors, p/w dyspnea



HPI: Pt has had difficulty with bp ctrl due to poor med compliance (SBP 160-190 in clinic). Had been on Atenolol and Zestril but pt self-D/C'd Zestril several wks ago because she thought the Zestril made her feel nauseated. Since then, has had gradually developing DOE   from baseline of walking over 4-5 flights of stairs without difficulty to dyspnea on only a flight of stairs. She underwent L knee arthroscopy for medial meniscal tear on 11/19/78 without immediate complications. At 3 am that night, though, woke up with severe dyspnea, with some relief upon sitting up. Associated with some wheezing; tried some of husband's nebs   only slight relief. Later over the day, dyspnea worsened to the point that only few steps would make short of breath. Some association with non-radiating substernal chest tightness in evening; no N/V, lightheadness, diaphoresis, or pleuritic CP, F/S/C, or cough. Next day, dyspnea persisted so pt came into ED.



In ED, found to have BP of 230's/120's, satting 70's on RA. CTA PE-protocol showing no PE or DVT but with pulm edema and bibasilar atelectasis vs. PNA (unlikely). Given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1    2.7 L diuresis; started on nitropaste, Captopril, Labetalol    BP down to 140's. Also given ASA and Lopressor x 1 and started on Heparin IV. Given Levoflox x 1 for ? PNA on CXR. Had to be on BiPAP for several hrs   transitioned to 3L NC, satting mid-90's. Transferred to floor for further mgmt.



Has had recent 8/78 ECHO   EF 67% with mild MR, TR, and AI; nl LV size and function without WMA.





ROS:

-Has had mild R subscapular dull pain on night before admission; not associated with her chest tightness or dyspnea; resolved on own on day of admission.

-Pt thinks L leg may be more swollen than her R

CXR: pulm edema 



A/P

51 yo F with no known CAD or CHF, p/w acute CHF in setting of severe HTN, c/b troponin leak



1.CARDS:  Suspect that pt had flash pulm edema from HTN due to poor med compliance as well as from  fluid re-mobilization post-surgery. Acute ischemic event possible given some EKG changes as well as mildly elevated troponin, but these findings could be also explained as demand ischemia event.



-Serial EKG's

-Cardiac monitor, telemetry

-Troponin elevation likely due to demand ischemia; subsequent level was lower, indicating resolving. Doubt ACS at this time but will continue to follow enz's

-ASA, Lopressor

-BP ctrl with ACE-I & B-blocker, aiming for SBP goal of 140's-160's for overnight  (BP had been as high as 230's)

-Lipitor; Check fasting lipids & glucose, homocysteine

-Lasix as needed, aiming for TBB goal of neg 1-2 L; Strict I/O's, qd wt's

-ECHO and Adenosine-MIBI (when more stable)

 

2. Leg Edema: Doubt DVT, but given recent surgery and lack of mobility, will check LENI's

-Fragmin for DVT prophylaxis

-F/U LENI's



3. Miscellaneous:

  	Nexium

  	MVI, Folate, Thiamine

  	PT consult

  	Nutrition consult



4. Anemia

-Guaiac all stools; Bid Hct's for now

-Check iron studies, hemolysis labs, peripheral smear, retic count

He has had some pain in his buttocks when he ambulates a short distance which resolves with standing still. Hip films were unremarkable. No calf pains. He saw Dr. Jaimes for a second opinion and was advised to exercise more and cut down on alcohol. He has had some anemia and his GI w/u at Fairfield was negative. I then started him on Coumadin which he finally started taking.

PATIENT/PHYSICIAN  He has wanted to see Dr. Jaimes in Cardiology. I explained to him that I am a cardiologist as well and that I have found in the past it does not work out well to have two cardiologists involved in his care. I think Dr. Jaimes is a superb cardiologist and I gave him the number for GCH teleservices to find himself a new internist. He clearly is somewhat conflicted about this and will think about it.

 PICH CLINIC VISIT

PT: Nora Greenwood

Date of Visit: 3/24/80

Contact information: 715-007-3511

Id/cc: 48F with PMH of type II DM, hyperlipidemia, obesity, hidradenitis suppurativa, and new diagnosis of fibromyalgia presenting to PICH for follow-up visit re: 1) DM; 2) HTN; 3) hidradenitis suppurativa 4) fibromyalgia/joint pain.

HPI: Interval hx to be reviewed by each issue.  

1) DM: Most recent HgbA1c on 12/31/79: 7.1 (down from 8.2). Nora reports fasting BS in the 140-150 and pre-dinner BS ~low l00's, but does not always check her FS on a regular basis. Noticed that her FS were running much high (>200) when she was taking the elavil for her fibromyalgia. She stopped the elavil bc of these elevated FS. Continues to take Glucotrol XL 2.5mg qd. Denies any episodes of hypoglycemia, but aware of possible symptoms and knows to keep candy with her at all times. Saw nutrition on 6/5/79 and feels that her diet has improved since this session. Continues to be quite active, walking a lot at her job (RN) and at home. 

2) HTN: Continues to take lisinopril 20mg qd; BP slightly elevated at last visit at 144/68. Plan to repeat BP check today and if still elevated to increase lisinopril. Denies chest pain, SOB, DOE, LE edema, pnd, orthopnea, recent visual changes, palpitations, or headaches. Has been shoveling snow on a regular basis without sob or chest pain. 

3) hidradenitis suppurativa: Nora recently completed 14day course of levaquin for a flare of her hs. In past, treated with diclox and augmentin; however, nora felt that both became less effective with time. Also treated with Bactrim which was d/c'd 2/2 stomach upset. Feels that acute inflammation is better, but still with baseline, fairly severe inflammation, discharge, and pain. Had been seen by general surgery in the past who felt that she needed to be seen by plastics. Was scheduled to see plastics in consultation, but was told that she had to pay 200.00 for visit even though she was free care and could not afford this. Continues to use clindamycin topical gel. Denies fever, chills, night sweats, or n/v. 

4) FIBROMYALGIA/JOINT PAINS: Nora was recently seen in urgent care on 2/13/80 with c/o diffuse joint pains and myalgias x 2 weeks. Urgent care w/u included a negative ana, RF, and normal parvovirus IGM level, but IgG was 7.79% (normal less than 1.1). Seen by Dr. Marshall in Rheum who did not feel that she had a ""bona fide synovitis"" but considered ddx including fibromyalgia and inflammatory arthritis. Further work-up included a negative anti-ccp, normal EST, and a negative ASLO. He started her on elavil to improve her sleep, but nora stopped 2/2 elevated bs. Does feel that improved sleep significantly improves her symptoms.

CC: Chest Pain    Cath    VF arrest    RCA stenting



History of Present Illness (obtained on admission):  Pt is a 48 yo male with h/o DMII, hypercholesterolemia, Bipolar d/o, and depression who began to have sub-sternal day prior to admission in car and pre-syncope + profound weakness.  This CP was minimal, but the weakness made him pull over.  He had a repeat of these symptoms day of admission.  His EKG c/w 2/2107 showed flattened T-wave in V2 and TWI in V3 and flattened T-waves in I, aVL. His trop was negative, but MB index was elevated.  Due to T-wave flattening, history and elevated index it was decided to start on heparin and ASA and take to cath lab.  



Cath showed right dominant system with prox Cx 40%, LAD clear, RCA prox 70-80% lesion and ostial PDA 90%.  During final dye injection, pt had VF arrest and 2 shocks.  Pt regained puls and was in AF (new) with RVR. Pt was started on amio.  Pt then began to experience discomfort in the RVR and it was decided to intervene.  POBA was done to ostial PDA.  A first no-eluting stent was placed in prox RCA and pt had dissection and thus 2cd stent was placed.  On admission to CCU, pt still in AF with RVR (120's).  He was on amio drip, BB, loaded on plavix, ASA, lipitor, integrilin and was placed on Avandia study.  His complaint of some mild chest pain (not same as anginal pain day before) thought to be from defibrillation.



Past Medical History: DMII, hyperchol, bipolar,HTN, depression (s/p ECT)

 

Medications on admission: ASA, Lipitor 20, lopressor 50 bid, folate, norvasc 5 qd; lithium, 300 bid; depakote 500 bid; sonata 10 mg qhs, doxylamine 25 qhs, mirtazapine 45 qd

Patient is here for follow-up.



1. CAD.  Patient admitted to the hospital in middle of November after she presented with pulmonary edema.  Ruled in for an MI and subsequent cardiac catheterization showed three vessel disease and she underwent three vessel CABG.  Postoperative course relatively smooth although she had been postoperative pneumothorax and had a chest tube which was only needed briefly.  Patient did quite well and was discharged to her daughter's home approximately 1 week after her surgery.  Prior to her surgeries there was a brief episode where patient was confused and was having trouble speaking, a neuro consultation was called, a CVA was ruled out and it appeared patient may have had changes secondary to medications.  Has not had any further recurrence of these symptoms.



Since her discharge patient has been doing quite well, no complaints of any chest pain, gets a little bit short of breath after exerting herself for a while but this is secondary to lack of conditioning and comes on gradually and results quickly as she rests.  Has more energy, had previously asked for a walk of a core she felt weak and now does not feel the need for this.  Also had had some lower extremity edema and this has now resolved.  Reports compliance with her new medical regimen with no untoward effects.  She was discharged to home without aspirin.  Patient followed by Dr. Nesbitt and has a follow-up appointment with him end of January, also has follow-up appointment with cardiothoracic surgery.



2.  Gastric ulcer.  Patient had a gastric ulcer last July, biopsy without any evidence of malignancy and no evidence of H. pylori.  During recent hospitalization had a follow-up EGD which showed no evidence of continued disease.  Patient does report that for the past two nights she has woken up during the night with some stomach discomfort.  This seemed to have been relieved this morning by Prilosec.  Not using any NSAIDs.



Social History: Living with her daughter for the moment in Culpeper Colorado but hoping to move back to her own apartment in Adrian.



Physical Exam



Patient is in no apparent distress.

Weight: 114 pounds

Blood Pressure: 114/56

Neck: supple without thyroidomegaly, no lymphadenopathy.  Without JVD.

Lungs: Clear.

Cor. S1, S2 without gallops, rubs or murmurs.

Abdomen: non-tender, without organomegaly. 

Extremities: without edema. 



Assessment and Plan



1.  CAD.  Doing quite well, continue current regimen.  Patient to call if any new complaints or problems, recurrence of chest pain.  Will speak with Dr. Nesbitt regarding whether she should restart aspirin q.day, contact patient if recommendation is to restart.



2.  Gastric ulcer.  Recent repeat EGD with no evidence of recurrent disease.  Now with some recurrence of epigastric pain.  For the moment she will increase omeprazole to 20 mg b.i.d. and take if this does for several weeks and then go back to previous dose.  If continues to have epigastric pain or needs higher dose of omeprazole will need further investigation.



I will see her for follow-up in two months.

Dictated at: 01/25/72 by HOLLAND KELLER, M.D. 

 
 
 
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:  
Dr. Hayden Avery 
 
REFERRAL SOURCE:  
Above.  
 
CONSULTATION REPLY 
 
Thank you for sending this patient for neurologic consultation.  I have reviewed or collected the primary data and examined the patient personally.  
 
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  62 year-old left handed white male (crossed right handed for writing), with bilateral buttock burning dysesthesias radiating down both lateral lower extremities.   
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old man with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, asthma, hypertension, attention deficit disorder, diabetic neuropathy and obesity who developed two years of gradually progressive discomfort in the lower extremities.  He has gained 40 pounds over the past two years and over that time course has noted that when he stands after about a minute he gets a firing burning pain in the left buttock just lateral to the spine which then radiates down the lateral aspect of the left leg.  If he shifts to his right leg, he gets a similar discomfort one or two minutes later.  This is relieved by sitting.  It will happen when walking as well.  This is distinct from the decrease in sensation and the tingling and cold feeling he gets in his feet due to the diabetic neuropathy.  He has had no back trauma, although he has a torn right ACL in the knee which leads to occasional falls.  Of note, he wears his wallet in his left rear pocket and tightens his belt to keep it at his waist.  
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history is as above and also includes a superficial varicosity in the right mid calf.   
ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, contrast medium, Ambien.  
 
FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory.  
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Hytrin, Cozaar 50 mg q. day, Ritalin 20 mg five times per day, glucophage 10 mg t.i.d., Rezulin 400 mg t.i.d., Neurontin 600 mg q.h.s. and Selexa.  
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is getting divorced and has four grown children all in good health.  
 
BIRTH HISTORY:  He was born with hammer toes and no other family member has this condition.  
 
EDUCATION:  He is a Consultant who works in Dupont.  
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has limited exercise and diet.  He has 30+ year history of cigarette smoking and has has no cigarettes in the last six weeks.  He denies alcohol use or recent recreational drug use.  He has no HIV risk factors.  
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  System review reveals normal bowel function with frequent small volume urination.  He attributes this to his Ritalin use and has not seen a urologist.  He has difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection and had only minimal improvement with Viagra.  When walking he develops some symptoms of claudication which were immediately relieved by resting.  There is no cardiovascular, respiratory or constitutional symptoms.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General: healthy appearance with a blood pressure of 175/90 in the left arm seated.  Pulse of 60 and regular.  Carotids 2+ without bruits.  Mental status:  Unremarkable.  Cranial nerves:  immature cataract, o.s.  No evidence of retinopathy.  
 
Motor:  normal tone and full strength in upper limbs.  Mild 5-/5 weakness in ankle extension bilaterally.  Mild distal atrophy in the foot intrinsics.  Rapid alternating movements intact.   
Sensation:  decreased to vibration and joint position in the feet bilaterally.  Mild decrease to pin over the medial nerve distribution on the right hand.  
 
The muscle stretch reflexes are absent at the Achilles and 1+ at the patellar, brachial radialis, biceps and triceps with flexor, plantar responses.  Finger to nose is accurate in both arms.  Gait is steady but distorted by the knee injury and slightly wide based.  He has a decreased tandem but can heel walk.  He has minimal unsteadiness in the Romberg position.  
 
DATA REVIEW:  MR imaging of the lumbosacral spine was performed at Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy and then again several days later at Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point (860-721-0108).  Report and films reviewed from Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy demonstrate no obvious focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis but some of the views are suboptimal.  The summary report from Bayonet Point suggests there may be some lumbosacral spinal stenosis and I await faxed copy of that report.  
 
ASSESSMENT:  
1.  Neuropathy.  The patient has likely multifactorial reasons for his lumbar spine pain.  He did undergo an evaluation by Dr.  Ulysses Harding which is unavailable at this time and one cortisone injection which was not effective at relieving his discomfort.  He likely has a combination of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, sciatic neuropathy and possible lumbosacral spinal stenosis or polyradiculopathy.  There is no evidence of diabetic amyotrophy.  I think at this point, an EMG with nerve conduction studies will be most helpful to identify the relevant contributions of these different factors.  I have also suggested that he invest in suspenders and carry his wallet in a different pocket to see if this will provide some relief.  He has tried a course of non steroidals without effect and I think I would like to begin with a low dose of amitriptyline as a neuropathic pain agent to supplement the Neurontin that he is on for other indications.  I will see him back in the office after the EMG has been performed and I have had a chance to review the MR imaging.  
 
Thank you for sending him to my office, it is a pleasure taking care of this gentleman and I am hopeful that we will be able to reduce his discomfort to some degree.  
 
The risks and benefits of any recommended or alternative treatments were discussed.  
 
DIAGNOSTIC CODE/LEVEL:  C5/peripheral neuropathy.

Her resting O2 sats are back to baseline and she does not appear to be in significant decompensated failure.  Unfortunately, we don't have much more to offer her in the way of cure (she has declined other interventions with pulmonlogist), as this is generally a terminal illness.



Plan:



--admit to medicine for further obs on tele.

--complete cycling enzymes

--continue outpatient lasix dose.

--adjust n/c oxygen as needed

--pulm/pt rehab consult -- pt has declined inpt rehab, but whatever might be offered as outpt would be helpful.

--i will speak with her re: potential for hospice care since she has declined inpt rehab at last and with this admission.  This might help forgo further hosptilizations with similar treatment at home.

--Continue DM treatment w/ glucophage/glyburide.

--anticipate d/c in 1-2 days.

-- pls offer pneumovax if she'll accept it.

-- hold coumadin, recheck INR (pls have anticoag clinic leave note with dosing of coumadin)

-- OOB to chair, ambulate with assistance.

Re:  Peggy Tinsley

Dear Dr. Ventura:
 
Peggy Tinsley was seen in the Renal Clinic today.  Her chief
symptomatic complaint is severe pruritus, which has not improved
much with Benadryl.  She has yet to fill the prescription for Sarna
lotion.  Her diarrhea has improved with Imodium, and she brought in
samples for cultures today.  Her appetite has improved somewhat.
She notes exertional fatigue and shortness of breath.  Medications
include Phoslo 1 tablet t.i.d., Lasix 160 mg b.i.d., Altase  2.5 mg
b.i.d., Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d., NPH 10 units q.d., iron t.i.d.
 
On examination, weight was 46.8 kilos, which is stable.  Heart rate
was 72, blood pressure 130/64.  JVP was clearly seen at 6 cm
greater than the sternal angle, and there was 1 plus peripheral
edema.  There was no S3.  Chest examination revealed bibasilar
inspiratory crackles.  Her left hand is no longer cold, but the
PTFE graft remains slightly edematous.
 
Blood work from May 30th showed a hematocrit of 23, potassium 5.2,
bicarbonate 15, BUN 91, creatinine 7.9, calcium 5.5., phosphate
5.2, albumin 3.4.
 
We will continue to hold off on dialysis until such time as Peggy's
PTFE graft is suitable.  This will save her the additional
morbidity of a semipermanent IJ catheter.  She is more hypervolemic
than last week, and I added Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg in the morning to her
diuretic regimen.  By oversight, she was not started on Rocaltrol,
and I have started her on Rocaltrol .25 mcg p.o. q.d., and
Nephrocaps 1 p.o. q.d.

GILLIS, BETTY
78865189
04/22/2085


Ines Estep, M.D.
930 Scotia Way
Big Bear Lake, CO  98839

To Dr. Estep:

I saw Betty Gillis in cardiovascular clinic with Dr. Vicente Noel on 04/22/2085.  Betty Gillis is a very pleasant 73-year-old woman who was recently admitted to the Griffin Memorial Hospital in early February 2085 with a right MCA territory stroke characterized clinically by drooling and left hand weakness.  Fortunately, her symptoms have now resolved and she is back to her regular activities.  We understand that she has also had previous strokes.  In December 2082, she was suffering a dizzy spell and subsequently an MRI of her brain found a posterior circulation cerebellar infarct as well as a couple of basal ganglia lacunar infarct.  She recalls having only V2 clinical events.

She was worked up in the Griffin Memorial Hospital and had a Holter, which demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with minor ectopy only, an echocardiogram, which was reported as essentially normal with the exception of a positive saline contrast bubble study suggesting a patent foramen ovale, an MRI of her head which demonstrated the infarct and marked microvascular disease, as well as a CT angiogram of her head and neck arteries, which demonstrated mild atheroma for the most part with a left internal carotid artery stenosis that was less than 50%.  She is referred to us today for an opinion as to how to manage the possible patent foramen ovale.

This lady has never had cardiac problems otherwise.  There is no history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure.  She does not get exertional chest discomfort (chest pain or shortness of breath) and has no history of syncope or presyncope.  She has no history of PND, orthopnea or edema.  She remains fairly active despite her ataxic gait.  She tells me that she is able to walk several blocks without difficulty and never has any exertional chest pains or shortness of breath.  Moreover, she does not have claudication.  Functional inquiry is otherwise unremarkable save for her usual difficulties with psoriasis and eczema.  She denies difficulties with heartburn or GI bleeding recently.

Past Medical History:
1.  Stroke.
A.  Subcortical basal ganglia stroke.
B.  Cerebellar stroke in December 2085 with subsequent ataxic gait.
C.  Right MCA stroke with left hand weakness in February 2085.
2.  Hypertension
3.  Dyslipidemia.
4.  Insulin insensitivity
5.  Ex-smoker (1-1-1/2 packs per day for approximately 40 years, quit approximately 12 years ago).
6.  Possible patent foramen ovale.
7.  Degenerative joint disease/osteoarthritis.
A.  Status bilateral total knee replacement in 2084.
B.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease/hiatus hernia.
C.  Status post GI bleeding (query secondary to esophagitis)
8.  Osteoporosis.
9.  Bladder incontinence.

There is no history of other cardiac problems.  There is no history of venous thromboembolic disease.  This lady has not had frank diabetes.

Allergies:  She has no known drug allergies.

Current Medical Therapy:
1.  Aggrenox 25/200 p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily.
3.  Doxepin 25 mg daily.
4.  Simvastatin 40 mg p.o. daily.
5.  Atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. daily.
6.  Fosamax 70 mg every week.
7.  BLANK 1 tab daily.
8.  Darifenacin 7.5 mg daily.

Family History:  Betty Gillis is adopted and does not know very much about her biological parents.  She believes that her biological father suffered a stroke at some point, but cannot say for certain how old he was.

Social History:  This woman is single.  She is a retired Secretary.  She is an ex-smoker (more than 40 pack years), but does not drink significant amounts of alcohol.  She has no other history of substance abuse.

Review of Systems:  Functional inquiry is positive for difficulties with psoriasis that are chronic and ongoing.  She has no other new symptoms.  There is no recent GI bleeding.  She has difficulties with bladder incontinence as well.

On physical examination today, her heart rate is 86 beats per minute and regular and her blood pressure is 122/78 in the right arm and 124/80 in the left arm.  Respiratory rate is 20 and she is pink on room air.  Head and neck exam is unremarkable.  There are no carotid bruits.  She has some kyphoscoliosis of her spine.  Her chest examination reveals no dullness to percussion and vesicular breath sounds only.  Her jugular venous pressure is not elevated.  Central pulses are normal in volume and contour.  Her apex beat is within normal limits.  Heart sounds include a normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs.  Her abdomen is soft and nontender.  There are no obvious masses.  Her aorta does not obviously appear to be enlarged.  Her pulses are palpable in her groin, but hard to feel behind her knees and distally.  They are symmetrical.  Informally, ABI test was not done today because she has several weeping eczematous lesions on her legs, which reflects psoriasis that has been excoriated.  A brief neurologic exam reveals dysmetria worse on the left than the right.

Impression:  Betty Gillis has had at least four strokes and has documented evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease and cerebromicrovascular disease on recent imaging.  We reviewed the echocardiogram today and we wished to confirm with the reading echocardiographer that it is indeed positive.  (It does not look particularly positive to our eyes).  Certainly, if she does not indeed have a patent foramen ovale, there is no issue as to what to do about it.  If she does have one; however, it seems more likely that her strokes reflect her atherosclerotic vascular disease secondary to her atherosclerotic risk factors and that the bulk of treatment should be directed at modulating those.

Her hypertension is controlled today.  Her dyslipidemia is not bad.  However, the LDL is 76 and perhaps there is some added benefit to increasing her simvastatin to 80 mg p.o. daily.  We also note that she has had elevated glucoses in the past, as high as 191, as well as an elevated hemoglobin A1c up to 6.5.  It is probably worth having her screen formally to see whether or not she has type 2 diabetes mellitus versus insulin insensitivity only.  She may benefit from an oral hypoglycemic.

We recommend.
1.  We will review the echocardiogram with the reading echocardiographer to ensure that it does indeed show a patent foramen ovale.
2.  We suggest that she increase her statin from simvastatin 40 mg p.o. daily to simvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily.  We will leave this to her primary care physician to organize.
3.  We suggest that she be screened formally for diabetes mellitus type 2.

We will see her again as necessary, but for the time being, we have no plans to perform an intervention on this lady.

PROBLEMS:  Ms. Youngman is a 37-year-old woman with the following 

medical problems:

1.	Diabetes.

2.	History of polysubstance abuse.

3.	Recent bilateral pyelonephritis.

4.	History of CIN 2 and laser to cervix.

5.	Depression.

6.	CAD with ischemia on MIBI in October 2093.

7.	Gallstones.

8.	Status post appendectomy in July 2093.

9.	GERD.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Include glyburide 15 mg p.o. q.d., Prevacid 

30 mg p.o. q.d., atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o.

q.d., and trazodone 150 mg p.o. q.h.s.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Youngman returns to clinic today 

for follow up regarding her diabetes.  Since I last saw her, she 

has been hospitalized with bilateral pyelonephritis in mid 

October.  Since discharge, she has been feeling well, and a 

repeat urinalysis and urine culture on October 27, 2094, were 

essentially within normal limits.  She denies any recurrent flank 

pain, fevers, chills, or dysuria.  Says overall she is feeling 

relatively well.  She is taking all of her medications as 

prescribed.  She denies any polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, 

fatigue, or blurry vision.  She continues to smoke.  She has not 

been exercising.  She also continues to have intermittent chest 

pain of unclear etiology.  Several days ago, she had an episode 

that lasted a minute or two at rest.  She described it as a 

tightness, and it was not associated with shortness of breath, 

nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or neck or arm symptoms.  She has 

no recurrent symptoms since then, and has had no exertional 

symptoms in the past few days.  She has not been taking her blood 

sugars at home as her machine is broken.  Also, she self-

discontinued her lisinopril.  She thought it gave her a headache.







Youngman, Codi

Page 2





PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is an obese young woman in no 

distress.  Pulse 68 and regular.  Blood pressure 134/84 and 

weight 226.  Fingerstick today 198.  Neck veins are non-elevated.  

No carotid bruits.  Oropharynx is clear.  Lungs are clear to 

auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac exam is regular rhythm.  

Normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs.  Extremities are warm and without 

edema.  Feet are without ulcerations and sensation is intact to 

vibration and light touch.



LABORATORY DATA:  Her EKG today reveals a normal sinus rhythm, 

normal axis, normal intervals, normal ST segments, and normal T-

waves.  Hematocrit and troponin are pending.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 37-year-old woman with multiple medical 

problems as follows:

1.	Type 2 diabetes.  Her hemoglobin A1c has continued to run in 

the 9.0.  She is poorly controlled and remains unwilling to 

try Glucophage again due to the diarrhea.  At this point, it 

is prudent to consider switching her over to an insulin 

regimen starting with b.i.d. NPH, and we will refer her to the 

diabetic teaching nurse, and see her back in about a month 

with a plan to transition her at that time.  Her urine 

microalbumin was negative a few months ago.  We will recheck 

her hemoglobin A1c today.  She has been to the ophthalmologist 

recently, and does not need to see the podiatrist as of yet.

2.	Regarding her chest pain, her persistent intermittent chest 

pain is somewhat concerning.  She does have coronary disease 

as per her MIBI just over a year ago.  She is taking an 

aspirin and a beta-blocker.  Her EKG today is normal, and she 

has been symptom free for at least the past 2-3 days even with 

exertion.  Given this, I advised her should she have recurrent 

pain at rest or with minimal exertion to call me and come to 

the emergency room, otherwise, to continue taking her aspirin 

and beta-blocker.  I will repeat her stress test to see if her 

ischemic burden has increased in which case we will consider 

referring her to Cardiology.

3.	Regarding her hypertension, given her diabetes, we would 

prefer better blood pressure control.  She agreed to try the 

lisinopril again at a small dose, and will let me know if she 

thinks it disagrees with her.  I told her I felt the headache 

was probably unrelated to the lisinopril.

4.	Regarding health maintenance, when I see her back in a month, 

I will do a Pap smear and give her a flu shot, as she left 

today without receiving one.  

5.	I will see her back in clinic in one month.

Attending Admission Note

HPI:  54 year old woman with h/o DM, HTN, and depression who is transferred to PSH from Missouri Baptist Hospital after being admitted from 2/15-2/20/83 and then readmitted on 2/22 with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  She has a h/o several admisions to the hospital for abdominal pain attributed to diabetic gastroparesis.  She has had an extensive GI work-up in the past including multiple abdominal CT scans, gastric emptying study, colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, and small bowel follow through.  All studies were negative except for the gastric emptying study.  She has been treated with multiple medications, including Reglan, Ativan, Compazine, and Zelnorm without much effect.  She is currently taking Neurontin and Cymbalta to treat neuropathic pain, and her PCP started her on MS Contin in December since nothing else seemed to be helping.  The pt states that the MS Contin helped during the month of December, but then it did not seem to be working as well.  The pt is distraught over her symptoms because the pain is severe and frequent.  She has been unable to return to work for 2 years because of the pain, and she would like to be able to do so.  The pain is not necessarily related to eating.  Yesterday, she felt well and was able to eat.  Today, she was doing fine until she had to drink the gastrografin, and then it escalated to an 8/10.  She received some IV morphine, and now it is down to 4/10.
	At Missouri Baptist Hospital, her MS Contin was held, but when her BP went up, she was restarted on it.  They also started clonidine BID for her uncontrolled HTN.  It appears that a AFP level was drawn and was elevated at 11.1.  However, it is written multiple times in the transfer materials that she had an elevated CEA level of 11.1.

REPORT:
     This study was reviewed by Dr. Yee and Dr. Janssen.
     HISTORY: As provided in the header.
     COMPARISON: 10/31/2081
     TECHNIQUE:
     Contiguous axial CT scans of both the abdomen and pelvis were
     performed from the lung bases to the proximal femora to assess for
     obstruction.
     Imaging was continued into the pelvis because a charge can affect
     both cavities.
     Abdominal and pelvic images were obtained following administration
     of both oral and intravenous contrast.
     FINDINGS:
     LUNG BASES. Linear densities in the lung bases likely represents
     atelectasis.
     HEPATOBILIARY.
     Liver. The liver is normal in appearance without evidence of
     biliary ductal dilatation or focal lesion.
     Gallbladder and Bile Ducts. Patient status post cholecystectomy.
     Pancreas. Normal in appearance.
     BOWEL. There is no evidence of the obstruction or bowel wall
     thickening.  A moderate amount of stool seen in the colon and
     rectum.
     GENITOURINARY:
     Kidneys. Normal in appearance without evidence of renal calculus
     or hydronephrosis.
     Ureters and bladder. Normal in appearance.
     Adrenal glands. Normal in appearance.
     Pelvic organs. Vascular calcifications are noted the pelvis.
     PERITONEUM:No evidence of fluid collection, free air or peritoneal
     mass lesions.
     RETROPERITONEUM:
     Lymph nodes. There are a few small bilateral inguinal lymph nodes
     present without bulk.
     Vessels.  Unremarkable.
     BONES AND SOFT TISSUES. Partial sacralization of L5.
     IMPRESSION.

Assessment and Plan	
54 yo woman with DM, HTN, and depression who has had severe chronic abdominal pain x 2 years.  Extensive GI w/u has been negative except for gastric emptying study.
1.  GI: Pain is responsive to morphine.  Will continue MS contin and treat with IV morphine prn for breakthrough pain.  Gastroparesis has been a working diagnosis since all other testing has been negative.  She has other complications of DM which does put her at increased risk for autonomic dysfunction of the GI tract.  Other diagnoses to consider are bowel ischemia, although colonoscopy and CT scans in the past have not shown any changes in the bowel consistent with this diagnosis.  We will order CTA of the abdomen to rule this out.  She did have a negative anti-endomysial Ab in 2081, but I think it would be worth checking both anti-endomysial Ab and anti-gliadin Ab to r/u celiac sprue again.  We will send both an AFP and CEA levels to f/u on the unclear laboratory abnormality from Missouri Baptist Hospital.
2.  HTN:  BP is very elevated today, and this may in part be due to stopping the clonidine (which may have been given to help with GI motility).  Will continue her on her 40 mg dose of Lisinopril and 25 mg of HCTZ.  In addition, we will treat her with hydralazine until we can get the BP down.
3.  DM:  Will  treat with Insulin NPH 25 u Q am, 20 u Q pm and with sliding scale regular insulin.  Will monitor BS.
4.  Pain management:  Will continue Cymbalta and Neurontin along the the MS Contin and prn IV morphine.

Educare-Fargo B Intern Admission Note


Patient: JACKS, Yasseen
MR #: 8841350
Admit Date: 2/09/50
Location: West 208
Attending: Dodge
PCP: Dr. Giovanni Gabriel (KEKELA / Keystone Heights)
Source: Patient, chart, ED pass-off
Code status: Full (presumed)
Contact: Son: Ursula 543-846-9534


CC: hypotension/unresponsiveness, cough


HPI: Mr. Jacks is an Indonesian 83M w/ HTN, dementia, OA and severe central canal stenosis (recent RCH admission 1/23 - 2/03/50 for associated LUE weakness), significant smoking history, RUL nodule (since &#8217;42), and h/o bronchiectasis, who presents from his nursing home w/ reported episode of hypotension and unresponsiveness on 2/08 around lunchtime.  Per notes, the pt was found to be unresponsive briefly after lunch, BP was checked and found to be in the 80&#8217;s systolic, EMS was activated and an IV was placed.  He quickly became responsive without intervention, and BP came up to the 80s/90s.  Per notes, no reported CP, abdominal pain, HA, LH, focal neurological symptoms, SOB, palpitations.  Of note, the pt was recently hospitalized at RCH 1/23 &#8211; 2/03/50 during which time he had labile BP&#8217;s including HTN as well as question of orthostasis, and was discharged on Hydralazine, HCTZ, Lisinopril, and Labetalol, after having taken only Atenolol and Terazosin on admission.  At rehab on 2/05 (3days PTA), his meds were changed to Atenolol, Terazosin, HCTZ, and Lisinopril.


In the ED, the pt&#8217;s vitals were T 96.4, HR 63, BP 98/53, RR 20, 95% on RA.  Labs sig for Na 129 (up to 131 after NS), Cr 1.58 (baseline 1.0 to 1.1 but recently 1.4 to 1.6), WBC 9.2 up to 15.6 (83% PMN) during time in the ED, Hct from 38.3 to 32.6 (MCV 85) in ED after fluids (guaiac negative), Head CT negative, CXR w/ slightly more prominent bibasilar L &gt; R opacities.  He also c/o cough while in the ED, w/ no other symptoms, w/ report of some rhonchorous breath sounds.  Two sets of blood cultures were drawn, he was given IVF (NS) at 120cc/hr, and he started on Vancomycin and Cefepime for presumed PNA.


On the floor, the pt complains of cough, mildly productive, but no fevers/chills, SOB, DOE, CP, hemoptysis, or any other sx, but is somewhat of a poor historian.  Of note, pt had recent chest CT (I+) on 1/27/50 to evaluate known RUL nodule, which showed likely aspiration PNA w/ multifocal dependent consolidation.  Pt initially was given 2days of Levofloxacin, but per Discharge Summary pt was not clinically behaving as if he had PNA, so Abx were stopped.


PMH / PSH:
-HTN (recent med adjustments as above)
-Osteoarthritis w/ severe central canal stenosis, recent admission 1/50 w/ LUE weakness/ataxia, followed by NSG/Neuro, currently working w/ PT, in neck collar currently
-RUL nodule first seen 2142, recent CT I+ on 1/27/50 showed 
-Left Thyroid nodule (1.7cm) noted on CT, unclear h/o any workup

___________________________________________________________________________


Impression/Plan:


83M w/ HTN, dementia, OA and central canal stenosis, smoking history, stable RUL nodule, h/o bronchiectasis, recent imaging suggestive of aspiration PNA, and recent BP med changes, who presents w/ hypotension and brief unresponsiveness at rehab per note.  Here w/ WBC elevation, cough mildly productive, no fevers/chills/myalgias or concern for influenza, but concern for PNA, especially aspiration PNA given prior CT findings, CXR w/ increased L opacity.  Will need to exonerate urine and blood as well; no meningismus on exam.  In terms of the hypotensive episode, likely in setting of mild hypovolemia plus several new BP meds from recent discharge, plus further titration at rehab in preceding few days.  Mildly dry on exam, w/ likely hypovolemic hypoNa but will follow. Hct drop since arrival, will re-check, possibly dilutional, guaiac negative.


** Infection / PNA
--obtain sputum sample
--Vanco and Cefepime given cough and WBC elev, presumed HAP (possibly aspiration)
--obtain U/A since none obtained in ED
--f/u blood ctx x 2


** Hypotension on arrival
--infectious workup / treatment as above
--will only give Labetalol and Hydralazine for now (holding ACEi, HCTZ given mild renal failure above prior baseline), add back Terazosin as necessary
--gentle IVF overnight, re-check a.m. lytes (likely mild hypovolemic hyponatremia) and orthostatics after volume challenge


** Anemia
--guaiac negative in ED, will guaiac all stools, type and cross
--f/u rpt Hct, consider iron studies, retic, etc.


** Renal failure
--at same Cr as last week&#8217;s admission, but up from his baseline; BUN/Cr ratio appears c/w pre-renal picture, will check urine lytes, assess response to IVF


** FEN
--Regular no salt added diet w/ Aspiration precautions; gentle IVF as above
--S+S consult


** Ppx / Other
--heparin sc, PPI, bowel regimen
--Full code for now, re-assess w/ son tomorrow

	BAUER CHIROPRACTIC CLINIC
	


	Interval History:
   Mr. Horn is a 60 y.o. male w/ h/o idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis s/p single right lung transplant in April 2094 whose post-op course has been complicated by CMV viremia, valcyte-induced myelosuppression and severe deconditioning.  Mr. Horn was most recently admitted from 12/11/94 through 12/30/94 for complaints of severe fatigue and dyspnea, although without symptoms of infection or acute graft rejection. His main complaint was generalized weakness and fatiguability even w/ very minimal activity.  Additionally, he reported a very poor appetite and continued weight loss. 

During that admission, he was transfused to a Hct&gt;30 and his PFTs ultimately returned back to baseline.  His weakness was felt to be primarily related to his malnutrition as he was documented as having an inadequate caloric intake. Nutrition was consulted, a PEG tube was placed and tube feeds were started to supplement his nutrition. He was discharged without incident on 12/30.

The patient continued w/ Nepro boluses and nocturnal TF at home and demonstrated an 8 lb weight gain in less than 2 months. He was improving until blood work revealed a positive CMV antigenemia (7 cells) on 1/29/95.  Transplant ID was consulted and the patient was restarted on Valcyte 450 QOD, and then later bumped up to QD dosing based on ID recommendations. He again experienced myelosuppression and was started on neupogen 300 mcg sc qd on 2/14/95 for a WBC of 0.6. At that time is HCT was 24.8 and PLTs 32K.  

A repeat CBC was obtained today and revealed worsening myelosuppression; Hct 21.6/Hgb 6.9, WBC 0.4 and PLTs 15K.   Case was discussed with Dr. Valerio and the patient was contacted and instructed to present to the BCC ER for further evaluation and treatment.

CARDIOLOGY

ALGIERS MEDICAL CENTER



Nicholas Osuna M.D. 

Internal Medicine

Algiers Medical Center

,  



Dear Dr.  Osuna:



  I had the pleasure of seeing Mr.  Nicholas Cortez in my office today in Cardiology for followup on coronary artery disease.  As you know, he is a 61-year-old white male who has a history of myocardial infarction approximately six years ago and had stenting at that time and subsequently had another stent placed in 2076.  He has done well since that time without any exertional angina, dyspnea on exertion, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema.  He has been followed here by Dr.  Opal Garner and has been noted to have an anteroapical aneurysm.  He underwent surgery for hip replacement of his left hip last summer and has recovered from that.  He did get on to about 220 pounds before the surgery, but has gained 20 pounds back and is now at about 240 pounds.  He says that most of this is because of inactivity.  He likes to work in his yard in Barnstable and plans to increase his activity and try and drop off some of that weight this summer.



Past medical history:

   Significant for diabetes, large anteroseptal myocardial infarction, sleep apnea, diverticulosis, tubular adenoma of the colon, and diverticulitis.



Current Medications:

  Imdur 30 mg qd

 Lasix 10 mg qd

 Lipitor 20 mg qd

 lisinopril 40 mg qd

 Plavix 75 mg qd

 aspirin 325 mg qd

 Prilosec 20 mg qd

 Toprol XL 25 mg qd

 nitroglycerin PRN



Family history:

   Unchanged from previous visits.



Social history:

   He is retired.  He lives in Barnstable.  He likes to work in his yard.  He quit smoking several years ago.



Review of systems:

   Unchanged from previous visits.



Physical examination:

-Pulse:   66 and regular

-BP: 130/70  

-resp. rate:   12 and unlabored

-General:   He is a well-developed, well-nourished white male in no acute distress.  Alert and cooperative.  Mildly overweight

-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Trachea is midline

-Neck:   Thyroid is nonpalpable.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits, have a normal upstroke.  JVP is less than 7 cm of water

-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes

-Cardiac:   Reveals a normal S1 and S2, with a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.  No organomegaly.  No pulsatile masses

-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.  He has trace pedal edema bilaterally



Procedures:

Echocardiogram test STATUS POST His last echo.  which showed an ejection fraction of 52% with some asymmetric septal hypertrophy with upper septal prominence.  There was trace MR and trace TR and the evidence of his apical aneurysm.

Stress test STATUS POST at that time as well as  07/10/2080. He exercised for 4 minutes, got to 44% of his predicted maximum heart rate.  There was no evidence of ischemia.  There was evidence of a previous anteroapical, anteroseptal infarct.



EKG:

    shows normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, right bundle branch block, and a possible old IMI and old ASMI.



Selected recent labs:

 The patient's last blood work was 08/17/2080 and at that time his BUN was 9, creatinine 0.8, potassium was 3.8, blood glucose 145, cholesterol was 96, triglycerides 70, HDL 42, and LDL 40.



Assessment and plan:

   In summary, this is a very pleasant 61-year-old gentleman who has a history of a big anteroseptal MI approximately six years ago.  He has had stenting of his coronaries in 2076.  He is without any evidence of ischemia at this time.  He has a fairly good LV function.  There is an LV aneurysm, but Coumadin has been deferred and he has been treated with aspirin and Plavix.  He is on a good medical regimen.  Blood pressure seems to be well controlled.  He does not have any evidence of severe decompensated congestive heart failure.  He does have some trace pedal edema.  His weight has gone up significantly since the operation for his hip and I have encouraged him to start walking program and try and drop off that weight this summer.  I would like to do CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, BUN, and a CBC with lipids today.  My plan would be keep him on his current regimen and see him back here in another six months to see how he is doing with his weight.  Cholesterol has been in very good shape and I do not expect that to be a problem.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. Noonan is a 69-year-old man who has type
II insulin-requiring diabetes, obesity, hypertension,
dyslipidemia, chronic atrial fibrillation, degenerative
osteoarthritis and diabetic neuropathy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He comes today complaining of one
week with mild chest pain not irradiated to the head, to jaw or
the arm, but with very mild shortness of breath.  He denies
nausea, vomiting or sweatiness.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d., verapamil SR
190 mg q.d., Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d., Neurontin 900 mg in the
morning 900 mg at noon and 300 mg at night, Lipitor 10 mg q.d.,
Zestril 10 mg q.d., Glucophage 1000 mg twice a day, and 75/25
insulin 40 units in the morning and 40 in the evening, Tylenol
with Codeine p.r.n. for severe pain and Coumadin 3 mg alternating
with 4.5 mg.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The blood pressure today is 120/88 and his
weight is 256 pounds.  The examination of the neck with no lymph
nodes.  He is oriented and in no acute distress.  The cardiac
examination with arrhythmia consistent with atrial fibrillation. 
The lungs with hypoventilation in both bases and no evidence of
acute congestive heart failure.  He has edema that has been
chronic in both extremities.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Review of an EKG obtained in August of this
year showed atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular or
apparently conducted complexes, nonspecific T-wave abnormality
probably digitalis effect, abnormal EKG that when compared to the
one in June showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities that were not
evident at that time and now present in anterior leads.

I have talked to people in the emergency department and he is
being sent right now for an evaluation of possible angina.

EDVISIT^51639357^Noonan, France^10/01/82^ELROD, RYLEY

This patient was seen on 10/01/2082 with the resident, Dr.

Jacob.  Please see her note for details.  The resident's

history and physical examination were reviewed and confirmed. 

Please see her note for details.  The plan of care and

disposition of the patient were discussed with the resident.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 70-year-old male who presents with two

weeks of back pain radiating from the mid back to the chest.  He

also has pain in his left leg up to his flank.  He also has some

scrotal swelling and lower abdominal pain.  The pain has been

intermittent and the patient has been taking Vicodin for the past

two days.  The pain that he has been having is actually chronic,

except for the left-sided flank pain and the chest pain.  He was

found on the ground by his daughter, and it was unclear to the

patient how he ended up in that position.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for myocardial infarction,

atrial fibrillation, diabetes, cerebrovascular accident, low back

pain, sciatica, Bell palsy, reflux, osteochondritis, peripheral

vascular disease, and diabetic neuropathy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile, heart rate 80,

respirations 16, blood pressure 126/82, and oxygen saturation is

100%.  He is in severe distress.  His lung exam is normal.  His

cardiac examination shows no abnormality.  His abdomen is

distended, and there is tenderness to palpation in the left lower

quadrant, and there is CVA tenderness in the left flank.  There

is also significant pain on movement of his left leg either

passively or actively.  It is not possible for us to evaluate the

strength in his left hip or knee because of pain.  He is alert

and oriented to person, place, time, and event.  His cranial

nerves are intact.  Rectal examination shows mildly decreased

sphincter tone, but no evidence of saddle anesthesia.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  Show a CK of 128 with MB fraction of 3.8,

and troponin I is less than assay.  INR is 2.8.  UA shows 0 to 1

white blood cells and 1 to 2 red blood cells.  Electrocardiogram

shows atrial fibrillation with bradycardic rate of 47.  His head

CT shows no abnormality.  There is stranding around his left

kidney.  The aorta appears normal.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was given an aspirin

325 mg p.o. and morphine 4 mg IV for pain.  His pain improved

significantly.  However, he had another recurrence of the pain

and with rising discomfort.  It was decided to admit the patient

to the hospital for management of his pain and further workup to

The meds were discontinued and she started a course of oral methylprednisolone. She stopped this several weeks ago because it made her jittery. Approximately the same time she began to notice that food and pills would feel stuck in the throat; on further questioning, she also may have noted the presence of white spots in the mouth around this time as well. No fevers, chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, headache, lightheadedness, vertigo, rash or new joint pain; no recent travel. She does note that her blood sugars at home have been consistently elevated to the 200-300 range.

In the ED, Ms. Fay was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. She was evaluated by the GI department. A screening HIV test was negative. She was found to have mild hyponatremia and mild hyperkalemia, as well as a question of subtle ECG changes. The above findings prompted admission for further workup.

ROS: Pertinent positives and negatives above.

PMH/PSH:   
Diabetes mellitus
Hypertension
Hyperlipidemia

ALT/AST normal
CK/MG/Troponin normal x 2 sets
UA: 3+ glucose, otherwise negative

MICROBIOLOGY: Urine culture pending

RADIOLOGY: None

ECG: NSR, incomplete RBBB; T wave flattening/inversion in V2-V3 that was not noted on 2094 ECG

IMPRESSION and PLAN: 66 year-old woman with solid/liquid dysphagia, oral candidiasis, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. The presence of thrush raises suspicion for esophageal candidiasis, though she does not report odynophagia. Mechanical obstruction should be ruled out. The presence of mild hyponatremia and hyperkalemia is likely attributable to the fact that she abruptly discontinued exogenous corticosteroids after a several week course; she is hemodynamically stable. Finally, there is little here to suggest acute coronary syndrome, though she falls into a subgroup of patients more likely to present with minimal symptoms. ECG warrants following. Diabetes is poorly controlled and may require initiation of insulin therapy; though sugars here may have been confounded by the dose of steroids given in ED.

CV: CR monitor overnight; cycle ECG and cardiac biomarkers; aspirin, continue beta blocker
Pulm: No issues; albuterol prn
GI: Upper endoscopy tentatively planned for the morning; NPO after midnight; continue home ppi
Endocrine: Sliding scale insulin, metformin; consider diabetes education, and discuss with PCP whether initiation of insulin is warranted. Check HbA1c, TFTs
FEN: Monitor lytes; lowfat ADA diet
Infectious Disease: Following EGD, fluconazole for candidiasis; leukocytosis is unexplained, but not focal evidence of infection
PPx: Enoxaparin may be started after EGD
Social work consult to assess support network and assist with discharge planning

Terry Iyer will assume care in the morning. Please page Dr. Iyer directly at 00450 with questions arising after 8:00am.

HOLCOMB,DENNIS   833-12-06-0                       VISIT DATE: 05/09/21

This patient was seen, interviewed and examined by myself as well 

as Dr. Petty whose I have reviewed and whose findings I have 

confirmed.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 53-year-old male who 

presents with complaints of palpitations, shortness of breath and a 

general feeling of weakness.  The patient states he has been 

feeling unwell for the past three days and has noticed his heart 

racing.  He actually has had his significant other take his heart 

rate and blood pressure while he was at home, and his readings have 

been in the 1 teens to 120s.  The patient has had a decreased 

appetite with vomiting and nausea as well as chest tightness in his 

mid-chest.  The patient felt himself get worse, and he, therefore, 

presents to the emergency department.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per the written note.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As per the written note.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished 

male in moderate distress.  Pulse 160-177, respiratory rate 40, 

blood pressure is 130/68, oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.  

NECK:  Supple, full range of motion, no jugular venous distension.  

CARDIAC:  Regular, tachycardic, no murmur is auscultated, clear S1 

and S2.  LUNGS:  Positive rales at the bases, otherwise clear, good 

air movement, tachypneic.  NEURO:  Alert and oriented x 3, follows 

all commands appropriate.  Further details of the exam are as per 

the written note.  

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Labs are significant for a glucose of 322, 

BUN of 31, creatinine of 1.8, bicarbonate of 19, CK of 186, MB of 

4.0, troponin of 1.11, calcium of 9.9.  White count of 15.6, 

hematocrit of 47.6, platelets of 206.  PT of 14.0, PTT of 29.0.  

EKG shows wide complex, regular, tachycardia.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen, interviewed 

and examined in the emergency department with labs obtained and as 

documented above.  In addition to the above studies, the patient 

had a chest x-ray which shows increased pulmonary vasculature.  The 

patient's EKG along with his history is concerning for a 

ventricular tachycardia.  The patient, therefore, initially 

received amiodarone.  The amiodarone affected no change in the 

patient's heart rate.  The patient remained tachypneic and 

tachycardic and generally well appearing.  The decision was made to 

proceed with cardioversion.  The patient received morphine and 

Ativan and had a synchronized cardioversion once at 52 volts with 

immediate change to sinus tachycardia in the 1 teens.  The patient 

stated that his chest tightness resolved immediately following 

cardioversion.  The patient received aspirin, beta-blockers, oxygen 

and heparin while in the emergency department.  He is on amiodarone 

drip.  Individuals from the Cardiac Service were contacted 

regarding possibly getting the patient to the catheterization lab 

especially in light of his ruling in for a myocardial infarction.  

The plan at this time is for the patient to be admitted to the CCU, 

be observed and then to proceed to cardiac catheterization 

thereafter.

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Cardiac Service.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:

1.  Myocardial infarction.

2.  Ventricular tachycardia.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

admitted in satisfactory condition.  Critical care time is 70 

minutes.

TRANSPLANT FELLOW ADMIT NOTE





HPI: 42 year old man s/p bilateral lung transplantation for bronchiectasis in 7/73 transferred from Burlington Obstetrics Gynecology Center for further evaluation of N/V/D, fever and hypoxia.  Over the past six weeks he had reported a slow decline in respiratory function  prompting a recent admission here 1/23 -25/77 for elective bronchoscopy to rule out rejection.  He noted a slight spontaneous improvement a few days before that admission.  Bronchoscopy showed no rejection but washings did grow M. catarrhalis -levaquin was begun on 1/25/77.  Pt reports continued slow improvement in dyspnea following discharge.  Yesterday morning he developed watery diarrhea (no blood or mucus) soon followed by nausea and vomiting (no blood or coffee grounds).  He went to BOGC and describes feeling increased dyspnea.  Found to be febrile to 101F and hypoxic (SpO2 94%, PaO2 53) and started on supplemental oxygen.  GI symptoms have since improved and pt is tolerating PO.  Denies chest pain, palpitations, cough, rash, HA, rhinorrhea, sore throat at any point during this illness.  Currently no dyspnea at rest.

Lung washings 1/23/77 - moderate M. catarrhalis



Path: Transbrochial biopsy 1/23 - negative for tissue rejection



CXR 1/31: Unremarkable 



Impression: 

42 year old man s/p bilateral lung transplant 7/73 for bronchiectasis developed acute GI illness in setting of levaquin tx for recent respiratory infection.  Now afebrile and with resolution of GI symptoms.  Remains somewhat dyspneic with normal BP and HR.  Azotemia possibly attributable to dehydration though concern for other etiologies as per Dr. Reilly's note.  WBCs reduced from recent levels.



Recommendations: 

GI illness: Mostly asymptomatic now though some concerning abnormalities remain (O2 requirement, low plt, low WBC, high Cr).  Remains hemodynamically stable.  Await results of panculture including stool studies (including C diff, E coli, Camphylobacter) when available.  

Transplant: Continue current immunosuppression and prophylactic abx.  Will consider holding cellcept, valcyte if leukopenia persists/worsens.  Follow daily cyclosporin troughs.  No evidence of rejection on recent biopsy.

Dyspnea: Consider aspiration though CXR negative, will follow.  Hold abx for now.

Renal: Azotemia of unclear etiology, follow up labs pending.  Renal consult per Dr. Reilly.

Internal Medicine

AMC Interoffice Mail

,  



Dear Dr.  Osuna:



  I had the pleasure of seeing Mr.  Nicholas Cortez in my office today in Cardiology at AMC.  As you know, he is a 61-year-old white male who has a history of myocardial infarction approximately six years ago, stenting at that time, and subsequently had another stent placed in 2076.  He has been noted to have an anteroapical aneurysm and when I saw him in October, was having some discomfort which may have been myocardial ischemia and angina.  His blood pressure was elevated, so we added Diovan to control the blood pressure.  He has had some dimunition in the symptoms and the frequency of these symptoms got arrangement for.  Exercise test was also put in place and the exercise results are now available as well as the echocardiography that had been scheduled at that time.  He still has occasional ankle swelling, but is able to walk without discomfort.  He has gained some weight over the summer and is having difficulties staying away from salty foods, particularly he likes pastrami.  He is no longer using a CPAP.



Current Medications:

  aspirin 325 mg qd

 Diovan 80 mg qd

 Imdur 30 mg qd

 Lasix 10 mg qd

 Lipitor 20 mg qd

 lisinopril 40 mg qd

 nitroglycerin



	Family history:

   Unchanged from previous visits.



	Social history:

   Unchanged from previous visits.



	Review of systems:

   Unchanged from previous visits.



Physical examination:

	

-Pulse:   80 and regular

-BP: 135/90  

-resp. rate:   12 and unlabored

-General:   He is a mildly overweight white male in no acute distress.  Alert and cooperative.  Oriented x 3

-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Trachea is midline

-Neck:   Thyroid is nonpalpable.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits, have a normal upstroke.  JVP is less than 7 cm of water

-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes

-Cardiac:   Normal S1 and S2, a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.  No organomegaly.  No pulsatile masses

-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.  He has trace pedal edema bilaterally



Procedures:

	

Echocardiogram STATUS POST shows an ejection fraction of 67%.  concentric LVH, mildly dilated left ventricle with regional wall motion abnormalities, trace mitral regurgitation, and trace tricuspid regurgitation.

Stress test STATUS POST nuclear stress test; which showed limited exercise capacity exercising for 5 minutes and 28 seconds.  Imaging showed an ejection fraction of 31%.  Perfusion images showed mild-to-distal anteroapical and septal scars associated with mild distal anterior ischemia.  The apex appeared more aneurysmal than the previous stress test and the LV was more dilated with a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction from 38 to 31.



	EKG:

    shows normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, and a right bundle branch block with an old IMI.



	Assessment and plan:

   In summary, this is a very pleasant 61-year-old gentleman who has a history of a large anteroseptal MI approximately six years ago, had stenting his LAD in 2076, and now has a recurrence of what sounds like possible angina and a positive stress test has a decrease in LV function, increase in LV aneurysmal dilatation, and ischemia in the anterior distribution. There is a discrepancy between the ejection fraction on the echo and I suspect that has to do with differences in technique. I have talked with the patient about cardiac catheterization and I would like to get him in for that as soon as possible so we can assess the degree of coronary disease. Hopefully it is amenable to percutaneous angioplasty, but I am somewhat concerned about the left ventricular aneurysm. We will arrange for cardiac catheterization either next week or the following week and I will plan to see him back here in the office approximately a month which will be after his catheterization and hopeful angioplasty.

NAME:    Vines, Stephen

MRN:     1672569



Mr. Vines comes in today.  He has been feeling pretty well though he is

distressed at his 18-pound weight gain.  His sugars were in the 300s before starting

the insulin.  Since he started the insulin, his sugars have come down nicely.  His

fasting sugars have been in the 120s.  His afternoon sugars have been in the 70-90s. 

He had a few hypoglycemic episodes early on but has not had some in almost a

month.  Other than that, he really has no new complaints.  He is still not smoking. 

He is still on the patch.  His neuropathy has not gotten any worse and he thinks he

can stop the Neurontin now.  He has not had any shortness of breath, cough or

edema.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As above.  No GI symptoms, no GU symptoms and no

new skin symptoms, no arthritic complaints. 



HABITS: Not smoking or drinking.  Not getting much exercise now.



PHYSICAL EXAM: His blood pressure is 140/80 on the left, 150/80 on the right. 

His pulse is 76 and regular.  Respirations are 16.  Lungs are clear. Heart: Regular

rate and rhythm, negative M/R/G.  No bruits heard.  Nasopharynx unremarkable. 

Abdomen is benign.  He has diminished pulses but good capillary refill in the feet. 

The cellulitis on the left ankle is completely resolved.  He has some neuropathy of

the feet with decreased sense to vibration in both feet, but his sensation to

monofilament is intact on both feet. 



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)  Diabetes.  Will check his hemoglobin A1c today.  It may still be a little bit

     high as he has undergone a rather brisk change since starting his insulin.  I

     encouraged him to check his sugars a couple times a week, especially in the

     afternoon.  If he continues to get low sugars, will cut back on his morning

     insulin to 35 units.  He is going to bring in a form for custom shoes given his

     neuropathy and is followed closely by Podiatry.  He had an eye exam earlier

     this year with Dr. Yousif.



(2)  Hypertension.  Will increase his Mavik to 4 mg a day.



(3)  Hyperlipidemia.  Recheck lipids and SGOT today.



(4)  CAD prevention.  He can't take aspirin so we will start Plavix 75 mg a day.



(5)  Status-post splenectomy.  He needs a Pneumovax booster 0.5 cc was given in

     the left deltoid.

HCP/FAMILY CONTACT: 



CHIEF COMPLAINT: &#8220;I came to the hospital b/c I have pneumonia&#8221;



HPI: This is a 84M with CAD s/p 4V CABG in 2091 who presents via transfer from Waverly urgent care after a chest xray showed pneumonia. The patient first presented to Waverly on 10/22 with complains of weakness, fatigue, decreased appetite and bilateral shoulder pain for a few weeks. He denied dyspnea, chest pain or pressure, productive cough, sore throat or runny nose. He was noted to have a fever of 101.2 at Waverly but denied other subjective fevers. His daughter had recently been hospitalized with pneumonia but he has no other sick contacts. At Waverly labs were drawn, a chest xray was done and he was given motrin and Tylenol and sent home. He returned for follow up the next day feeling no better. His labs reviewed a leukocytosis and acute kidney injury and his chest xray showed a RLL pneumonia. He was sent to the CGH for further evaluation.



On presentation to the ED at 1pm on 10/23, his VS were 98.2, 87, 122/60, 97% on 2LNC. He got 500cc of NS, Levaquin 750mg PO x 2, Ceftriaxone 1gm IV x 2 doses, his home doses of dilantin, finasteride and plavix and sent to the floor. 



Upon arrival to the floor he was in no distress. In addition to the above, he denied recent vomiting, diarrhea or feelings of numbness or dizziness. He has had less appetite recently. He denied injury or trauma to his shoulder which he said had been bothering him more and more for the past 3 weeks. 



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per HPI. Other systems reviewed were negative in detail.

RH Cath (3/97) DIAGNOSTIC CONCLUSIONS/OVERALL SUMMARY:


1. Right heart catheterization - normal filling pressures. Hemodynamics: RAP 


1, RV 25/2, PAP 25/6, PCWP 6, CO 5.73


2. RV biopsy was performed using a shor sheath through right internal jugular 


vein approach.


3. A total of 4 biopsy obtained, fixed in formalin and sent to pathology. 


Closing RAP 2.

Nuclear Stress 12/96 CONCLUSION

       The ECG is negative for ischemia.  The sensitivity of

       adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting CAD is limited.

       LV contractile function is normal.

       The perfusion iamges show a large area of mild ischemia involving

       the anteroseptal and inferior walls



TTE: 11/96. EF 60%, mild/mod MR and inferior wall motion abnormalities.

Endocrinology Fellow Consult Note



Date: 	09-30-2081

Name:	Nicole Frantz

MRN:	236-07-19

	

Requesting Service:	Medicine

Reason for consultation:   Diabetes, gastroparesis

	

HPI:  52-yo woman with poorly-controlled DM diagnosed 2061 and h/o gastroparesis, retinopathy, nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy, and  with multiple visits and three recent admissions for n/v/gastroparesis: May 1-3and June 7-21, July 22. Her GI symptoms began in December, 2080. Delayed gastric emptying by nuclear medicine study, with 9% emptying at 60 minutes and 29% emptying at 90 minutes. 



Originally, she had been on oral medication and has been on insulin since 2076, initially on NPH bid and then switched to Lantus.  After her admission June 2081, she was placed back on NPH from what had been lantus 40 U qhs + metformin 1000 bid. HbA1C was 12.2, 4/2081, more recently it has been 10.2 in 7/2081 and 10.1 on 9/14/2081. 



On her last visit to see me in diabetes counseling approximately 10 days ago, gastroparesis was under good control without nausea or vomiting. Glycemic control, however, was poor, and it was clear to me that she was not properly administering a sliding scale, and this was too complex for her. Accordingly, and in response to severe hyperglycemia and a hemoglobin A1c above 10, we changed her reigimen to NPH 70/30 50Units BID. 

Her known diabetic complications include retinopathy with prior photocoagulopathy, nephropathy with microalbuminuria, neuropathy with intermittent numbness and tingling at night in feet, and no known macrovascular disease. Gastroparesis may be the consequence of poor glycemic control or frank autonomic neuropathy, but is often multifactorial. 

She was re-admitted to the PSH on 09/30/2081 after having 2 days of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. She was unable tolerate any oral hydration in the ED, and was admitted for management. 

On ROSystems and history, she reports that she had been taking her new 70/30 insulin, 50 units BID. Sugars had been running 200s, all the time 200s, no better or worse. Nausea per her report began suddenly on Friday evening 09/27 and got gradually worse. Currently nausea has abated, but abdominal pain persists.

Written only for insulin sliding scale. Glucose 500+ on admission with anion gap of 20 that closed rapidly with hydration.

Impression   52F with poorly controlled type II DM and known neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy and gastroparesis, repeated admission for nausea, vomiting, poor nutrition. Found to be profoundly hyperglycemic on admission with BG of 526 with anion gap of 20. Rapidly closed anion gap to 10 with hydration alone.  Abdominal pain can be multifactorial. I don't doubt that this is most likely hyperglycemia with associated gut dysmotility, but differential includes small bowel angina (pain is definitely out of proportion to exam and seems colicky), hepatobiliary disease. With normal anion gap, I doubt that this is ischemic disease of the gut, but small bowel angina is still a possibility. 

Recommendations: 

1)	 Gastroparesis may be in part due to poor glycemic control, we need to achieve better glycemic control to help with gastric motility. 

a.	Would not hold long acting insulin. Start NPH 30U BID,    dose if NPO

b.	While NPO, have D5 running in IVF once fingerstick drops below 200, especially once NPH started. If she needs IVF at a higher rate, you might run D5NS at 50cc/hour along with NS or    NS at whatever rate is needed.

c.	Continue sliding scale insulin Q6H when NPO, QAC and QHS when eating, but change parameters to tighten coverage as follows:

i.	Fingerstick <150, 0 units; 151-200 4 units; 201-250 6 units; 251-300 8 units; 301-350 10 units, >350 12 units. 

d.	Start mealtime insulin (clearly hold while NPO) of 10U regular pre-breakfast and pre-dinner. Hold if NPO or PO intake poor. She will need rapid uptitration from this point once eating. 

e.	No metformin for now given GI upset. 

2)	Agree with other therapies for gastroparesis as she had been on as an outpatient, including ativan, reglan, zofran PRN, zelnorm, miralax, colace. 

3)	For crude r/o of poor circulation to gut you could send a lactate level and check stool guaiac. Colonoscopy and endoscopic exams were normal earlier this year, but this does not exclude small bowel angina. Study of choice would be MR angiography or CT angiography of abdominal vessels. I do not think this is warranted at this point, but ischemic small bowel should remain on the differential.  

4)	With hyperdynamic precordium and tachycardia, would check TSH, though this is almost certainly due to hypovolemia and compensatory response. 

Thank you for the consult.  

We will follow with you.  Please call with any questions.

Will staff in AM.

HPI: 61y/o male who underwent heart transplant in 2083 and has ESRD on HD (recently started -&gt; 9 sessions so far FAT). 
He is been electively admitted from his cardiologists office w/ slightly elevated troponins peaked at 0.41, most recent 0.24.  He is CP free and stable and is being transferred for further evaluation and work up.  Last HD session on Tuesday. 


Last dobutamine echo last year showed some LV apex hypokinesis, which augments in response dobutamine. 


ECG revealed NSR at 82 w/ poor R wave progression on anterior leads. Qwave on AvL but no new TWI or ST changes. 


Echo at OSH reveiled lower EF at 30-35% with HK on anteroseptal, mid anterior, apical lateral and apical inferior walls segments. 


He reports chronic dypsnea on moderate exertion. He is quite sedentary. 


ROS: preserved appetite. 


PMH: CAD, obesity, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea wears cpap at night, ESRD hemodialysis dependent, depression and GERD.  


His current medications include aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily, Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d., Cardizem CD 360 mg p.o. daily, Effexor 125 mg p.o. daily, , Lantus 120 units subcutaneously b.i.d., Lasix 60 m p.o.

IMPRESSION
61 yo M s/p heart transplant and ESRD on HD presenting with elevated troponin. The trend of his creatinine from outside hospital is not suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. Troponin leak is a common finding in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis since the hemodynamic changes lead to subendocardial ischemia during short-time ultrafiltration. On the other hand, due to the difficulty in evaluating ACS in patients that had undergone transplant, will repeat cardiac markers for the next 12 hours and meanwhile, continue medical management with ASA, statin, BB and heparin. The lower EF on outside echo could suggest as well recent past event of myocardial infarction, especially with the multiple walls demonstrating hypokinesis. 
&gt; Continue other home meds.
&gt; Check CSA level in am.
&gt; Since stable volume status, consider contacting renal in am for further decision about next HD session depending on lab results. 
&gt; Will continue lasix on nonHD days. 
&gt; Will defer further testing to primary cardiologist in am.
&gt; CPAP at night
&gt; Keep NPO after MN. 
&gt; Will check PTH, iron store, Ca/PO4 and 25 vitD.

Dear Dr. Feldman:

We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Cora Quinley in followup
today in the Cardiology clinic.  As you know, she is a
very pleasant 72-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension,
dyslipidemia, active tobacco use, there is probable coronary
disease, with preserved left ventricular function (EF 60% on
echo), as well as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.  She
last saw me in clinic in 03/2077, and missed several followup
appointments in part because she spends much of her time in
Oregon.  Over the past year and several months, Ms. Quinley has
been doing quite well.  She states that she has episodes of
palpitations approximately every 2 months, lasting less then 5
minutes.  She notes a sensation of fluttering in her chest, with
no chest tightness, no dyspnea, no lightheadedness, no syncope. 
She denies PND, orthopnea, or angina.  Unfortunately, Ms. Quinley
continues to smoke, but is actively interested in quitting.  She
states that she is planning to enroll in the Stonybrook Smoking
Cessation Program.

Her current medications include enteric-coated Aspirin 325 mg
q.d., atenolol 100 mg q.d., lisinopril 20 mg q.d., Lipitor 20 mg
q.h.s., metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., Micronase, fluocinolone,
Protonix, and Allegra.

On examination, she is well appearing today in no distress. 
Blood pressure is 128/60 mmHg in the right arm, and pulse is 65
beats per minute.  Extremities are warm, with no peripheral
edema.  Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally with no bruits. 
JVP is 8 cm of water.  Chest is clear to auscultation and
percussion bilaterally.  PMI is nondisplaced, with a normal S1,
physiologically split S2, soft S4, no murmurs, no rubs.  Abdomen
is soft with no masses or hepatomegaly.  Pulse examination is
normal.

Recent lipid profile from 03/2078 reveals a LDL of 150.

ECG today demonstrates normal sinus rhythm at 67 beats per
minute, PR interval 154, QRS duration 78, QT interval 442, QTC
467, and QRS axis 33 degrees.  There is a nonspecific Q-wave
abnormality, and prolonged QT, with no significant change
compared to prior.

In summary, Ms. Quinley is doing quite well.  Her palpitations and
likely SVT are occuring at a frequency that Ms. Quinley feels are
quite acceptable for her.  Therefore, she wishes no consideration
of possible interventions or changes in her medical regimen.  She
has no symptoms to suggest current coronary ischemia.  Regarding
her cardiovascular risk factors, her blood pressure is reasonably
well controlled today, and you are actively managing her
diabetes.  However, her lipid profile demonstrates an elevated
LDL.  Therefore, I have taken liberty of increasing her Lipitor
to 40 mg q.h.s.

I plan to see Ms. Quinley in followup in approximately 6 months. 
Please feel free to contact me otherwise regarding her
cardiovascular issues.  Thank you very much for referring this
very pleasant woman for cardiovascular care.  

Ms. Quinley was seen, examined, and discussed with our clinic
preceptor, Dr. Queen Frank-Newman.

1. OBESITY - he feels his weight is down a little.  He has been trying to eat

mainly meat and vegetables, but he is ""stupid"" sometimes and cheats.



2. HYPERTENSION - in good range.  He has been making an effort to avoid Na.



3. PROTEINURIA  - he has been off Naprosyn for about 6 weeks, has appt scheduled with Dr. Fry 6/05.  Will plan to repeat 24 hr urine for protein towards the end of next week.  His pedal edema has improved considerably, so possibly his albumin is better.



4. DJD - Ultam is helpful, but not as good as Naprosyn.  Knees and ankles are stiff and painful, especially if he is active and then sits still for a while.

Also has some pain in left groin/thigh c/w tendonitis.

                                              11-30-93 



IDENTIFICATION:  Ms. Youngman is a 36 year old woman with the following 
medical problems: 

1.   Type II diabetes mellitus.
2.   CAD.
3.   History of CIN2 status post laser treatment to the cervix.
4.   Depression.
5.   History of substance abuse.
6.   GERD.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Enteric-coated aspirin 325mg PO q.d., atenolol 
25mg PO q.d., glyburide 5mg PO q.d., Lipitor 10mg PO q.h.s., Celexa 20mg 
PO q.d., Zantac 150mg PO q.h.s., Prevacid 30mg PO q.d., trazodone 150mg 
PO q.h.s.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Youngman returns to clinic today to 
follow up regarding her diabetes, coronary artery disease, and 
depression.  Since I last saw her, she presented to Urgent Care 
complaining of some epigastric discomfort and was referred to 
Gastroenterology where apparently she was started on Prevacid at 30mg a 
day in addition to maintenance with q.h.s. Zantac and scheduled for a 
upper GI series with a small bowel follow-through with a plan to add a 
pro-motility agent if there was no structural abnormalities on her GI 
study.  She is scheduled later this month.  She has no new complaints, 
although she recently stopped taking her glyburide and has not refilled 
it over the past two days.  She denies any increasing polyuria, 
polydipsia, polyphagia.  Says until yesterday, she had been taking all 
of her medications regularly, although mostly at night rather than in 
the morning.  I pressed her about this because she has a history of 
being noncompliant with her medicines in the past, but she does maintain 
that she has been taking them.  It is not entirely clear to me whether 
this is true or not.  

Regarding her depression, she denies any suicidal ideation.  She says 
she is feeling a little bit better.  She was recently started on 
risperidone in addition to her Celexa, apparently by a psychiatrist at 
the Connerstone Regional Hospital by the name of Dr. Lehman whom she sees once 
a month.  She is also seeing a counselor there weekly.  She says overall 
she is doing a little bit better, although still intermittently binge 
drinking and occasionally smoking marijuana.  We again discussed the 
importance of AA; she says she is not interested in that.  

Regarding her coronary disease, she continues to have exertional angina 
after approximately 14 steps which has not increased in intensity or 
frequency.  She denies any PND or orthopnea, denies any chest pain at 
rest.

blood sugar in the office today was 331.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  Thirty six year old woman with multiple medical 
problems, including a history of noncompliance and substance abuse.

1.   Diabetes.  Her last hemoglobin A1C was approximately 9.3, 
     essentially unchanged from six months prior.  Finger stick in the 
     office is 331 today, confirming her recent noncompliance and would 
     now describe that she has not been taking her medicine regularly 
     over the past couple of months.  In any event, she most likely need 
     a higher dose of sulphonurea.  We will check a hemoglobin A1C 
     today, and if it remains in the 9 range or higher, will increase 
     her glyburide to 10mg daily, and I talked to her about the plan.  
     Her last urine microalbumin was negative.

2.   Hypercholesterolemia.  When she returns to clinic in three months, 
     we will recheck a lipid profile by which time she will have been on 
     Lipitor for approximately six months.

3.   Coronary disease.  She is still having exertional chest pain.  
     Increased her atenolol to 50mg PO q.d. as she did have room to go 
     with her pulse and blood pressure.

4.   Depression.  I again encouraged her to continue following up with 
     her psychiatrist and her counselor.  Again, reinforced the 
     importance of trying to remain substance free and recommended AA 
     again as I have in the past.

5.   GERD.  She will follow up with Gastroenterology and continue on her 
     PPI and H2 blocker for now.  I told her she should take the 
     Prevacid in the morning and the Zantac at night only.

6.   Health maintenance.  She received a flu shot and she will return to 
     clinic in three months to follow up on her diabetes, 
     hypercholesterolemia, and coronary disease.  Additionally, I 
     referred her to Nutrition for further counseling regarding weight 
     loss and a heart-healthy diabetic diet.  I also stressed the

                                             FPM#:  236-67-03-3
 
 
Dear Dr. Stafford:
 
     I was asked to provide a cardiologic evaluation on Mrs.
Tinsley with a concentration on her appropriateness to be listed
as a recipient for a cadaver renal transplant.  In summary, she is
a 46 year old woman who has been an insulin dependent diabetic
since the age of 29 and has been on hemodialysis since 2083.  By
report, her other complications for diabetes include retinopathy,
peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease.  In viewing
her present history, she works in the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt learning technology department.  Her
three times a week hemodialyses are uncomplicated.  She does,
however,  experience occasional chest pressure with activities and
on rare occasions has had nocturnal angina.  These episodes are
relieved by nitroglycerin.  Mrs. Tinsley has also noted that with
walking she will occasionally get short of breath which is relieved
by slowing down.  
 
     In addition to diabetes and hypertension which was present
only pre-dialysis, she has been and continues to be a smoker.  Her
cholesterol by one report was 228 mg/dl.  I don't have
fractionations and her family history is unknown.  
 
     A report of an echocardiogram from April of 2083, shows mild
ventricular hypertrophy in the presence of mitral insufficiency,
preserved LV size and function.  She had an exercise tolerance test
in February of 2085.  On a modified protocol, she went for less
than 4 1/2 minutes.  This is equivalent to not even completing
stage 1 of the standard Bruce.  With that, she did develop chest
pain and had 2 mm of ST depression. That study was accompanied by
both fixed and reversible isotopic perfusion changes in the septum
consistent with prior non-transmural infarct with exercise induced
ischemia.  As was apparent to those involved, even the non-isotope
portion alone was worrisome for high grade coronary disease and led
to the recommendation for a cardiac catheterization.  
 
     That study was done in Macdonald Hospital and at this time, I
only have the report.  However, from this report, there was
preserved LV function with anterior lateral hypokinesis and trace
MR that is consistent with the echo and the thallium studies. 
Coronary angiography showed by report, diffuse involvement of
proximal mid-LAD without specific focal stenosis until an 80% mid-
LAD.  The circumflex was also diffusely diseased and there was a
discrete stenosis in the mid section of a large marginal.  The
right coronary artery was diffusely diseased with a discrete
stenosis.  At that time, the recommendation was to continue medical
therapy.  
 
     Her medical therapy at this time is estrogen replacement with
prempro 2.5 mg once a day, tenormin 25 mg qd, aspirin one every
other day in addition to her supplemental vitamins, iron and twice
daily insulin therapy.  
 
     In rounding out her medical history, her surgical procedures
have involved the hemodialysis access.  She has had one pregnancy
28 years ago without complications.  I also elicited a history of
some focal arm weakness and occasional slurring of speech.  This
was difficult to pin down, but is of some concern.
 
     On exam, her blood pressure was 150/80  mm Hg, pulse 90
regular, her weight 95 lbs.  Her hemodialysis shunt is on the left
arm.  There was a right carotid bruit, neck veins were not
distended.  Lungs were clear, PMI was displaced and sustained. 
There was an S4, no S3 and there was a holo systolic murmur at the
apex.  Abdomen was benign, femoral pulses were intact, extremities
were without edema.  The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm,
diffuse STT changes.  There were no pathologic Q waves.
 
     Although the focus of this evaluation was originally for
transplant candidacy, I am concerned about her current cardiac
status.  She is a young diabetic woman, symptomatic of both
shortness of breath and chest pain and on exercise test, has
limited functional capacity.  The coronary angiography reveals a
presence of multi-vessel disease.  Even without seeing the primary
data which I hope to do in the next week, it would be unlikely that
she would be an angioplasty candidate, given the poor results in diabetics.  
Therefore, coronary revascularization for her would be coronary artery 
bypass surgery. 
 
 
     Obviously, I would like to review the films first, and speak
with Dr. Upson regarding augmentation of her anti-anginals.  I
would also like to add pravastatin at this time, starting with only
10 mg and obtain non-invasive studies of the carotids.  As
indicated, although the focus of this evaluation was her
suitability for transplantation, the issue of controlling
symptomatic coronary artery disease in this young woman became more
pressing.
 
     I look forward to working with you and the other physicians in
her care.
 
 
                                   Sincerely,

The patient was seen with Dr. Izaguirre.  Resident's note was

reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined by me.  Please see

the resident's note for details of the patient's past medical,

social, family history, review of systems, and physical exam.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  EKG changes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old woman with a

history of 2 ischemic strokes in the past, hypertension and high

cholesterol who presents with 1-2 weeks of feeling tired after

breakfast.  She went into Copley Hospital with this complaint today,

is a somewhat difficult historian but denies any chest pain,

shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, arm pain,

diarrhea, constipation, dyspnea on exertion, recent change in her

medications or any other complaints.  Today, she had the symptoms

and was seen at the outside office.  An EKG was performed there

for which she was sent here with a reading of a T-wave inversion

in V2 and V3.  There seems to be lead placement problem V1 and

V3.  Leads appeared ____, but there is a slight T-wave inversion

in what would be V1 and V2, which seems to be new from prior EKG.

 Placement of leads could not be confirmed at CH.  The patient

was sent in here and arrived chest pain free and otherwise

asymptomatic.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, high cholesterol, COPD,

arthritis, ischemic strokes x2, GI bleed in the past,

osteoporosis, and colon polyps.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Bilateral total knee replacements.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a past smoker, never used drugs.  Lives

alone.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unclear as the patient is adopted.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative except for some ____.

MEDICATIONS:  The patient takes PPIs, Prilosec, calcium,

atenolol, Aggrenox, iron, doxepin, Detrol, and simvastatin.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile, normal and stable vital

signs.  Pulse 73 and blood pressure 129/80.  Awake, alert, in no

distress.  Her exam is essentially unremarkable including clear

and equal breath sounds, normal JVD and regular rate and rhythm. 

No murmurs on cardiac examination.  Abdomen is soft and

nontender.  Skin is warm, dry, and intact except for some

psoriatic lesions that are old.  She has no pedal edema and the

rest of her examination is essentially unremarkable.  EKG in the

Emergency Department shows sinus rhythm at 65 with an upgoing

T-waves in all the precordial leads.  Laboratory examination

reveals negative cardiac enzymes and is otherwise unremarkable. 

PTT 21 and INR 1.  Chest x-ray shows no acute changes.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  She was seen by the CH

cardiologist, Dr. Brock.  In the Emergency Department, given

the patient's vascular disease, the plan is to admit for 2 sets

of enzymes and a stress in the morning.  She is well appearing at

the time of admission.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  EKG changes.

Admission Note

HPI: 73 year old woman with hypertension, DM, peripheral vascular disease presents with dyspnea on exertion for 2 days. Th patient was well and normally active with walking and usual activities without DOE until 2 days ago. Last routine visit was in 9/91 w/ her PCP and was fine. 2 days ago noted DOE when going to store. This persisted w/ activity only. The patient was fine at rest and was able to sleep without difficulty. There were no recent changes in her meds. She had no other symptoms including CP, dizziness, URI symptoms, fever, chills, GI symptoms. No PND, orthopnea.



She previously had a cardiac evaluation during a similar presentation in 2085. She had a low level stress test and echocardiogram. No ischemia was demonstrated at a very minimal exertion. The echo showed LVH and an EF of 61%. Because of an impending snow storm, she decided to come to the hospital for evaluation. In the ED her BP was elevated and her 02 sat was only 78% on RA.



PMH:

1. Diabetes mellitus: on medical regimen, HgA1c 7.3 (9/91).



2. Hypertension: Blood pressure is 140/72.  Echocardiogram 12/85 - EF 61%, LVH. ETT 12/85 - 4 METS, no wall motion abnormalities.



3. Hypercholesterolemia: on Lipitor 10, LDL 78 (4/91).



4. Peripheral vascular disease: arterial studies 10/90 - left SFA occlusion, and bilateral distal popliteal/ tibial

vessel disease.  She is well collateralized across the ankles at rest and poorly collateralized across the ankles post exercise.  Perfusion is adequate to the TM level, and poor to the digital level, bilaterally



5. Anemia: normocytic normochromic anemia with a normal SPEP and UPEP and iron studies. Baseline hematocrit of low 30's.



6. Obesity. 



7. Osteopenia with a history of right radial fracture.

CXR (AP): No radiographic evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary process.



CT chest/abd/pelvis: 1. No evidence for pulmonary embolus to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries.  However, evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature is suboptimal due to respiratory motion. 2. No evidence for deep venous thrombosis. 3. Small right pleural effusion. 4. Intravenous contrast noted within the hepatic veins which could be secondary to CHF.



EKG: NSR, LVH, 1st degree AVB, nonspecific ST, TW changes.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 73 year old woman with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia who presents with exertional dyspnea. The patient's history, exam and CXR are not consistent with CHF. The CT scan r/o PE and may be consistent w/ failure, but not clear. More likely would be ischemia and is ruling out for an MI. Clearly needs cardiac reassessment with echo and ETT. Last ETT in 2085 but was normal at a very low level of exertion. Finally, could this be a primary pulmonary process? If her 02 sat of 78% in the ED is true, this should be pursued if cardiac evaluation is negative. Specifically could she have an interstitial pulmonary process corresponding to imaging and exam w/ fine crackles. Arguing against this is the acuteness of her symptoms. Continue current regimen w/ holding Avandia and metformin.

Chief Complaint: 

Shortness of breath



History of The Present Illness:  

	Mr. Kaufman is a 53 year old man with a history of Insulin-requiring DM, HTN, chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C presents with a chief complaint of acute onset shortness of breath. He was in his usual state of health when one week PTA he decided to abruptly discontinue his Fentanyl patch, which he had for three years at 75mg for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy and gastroparesis. He recently decided he no longer wanted to wear the patch because he was concerned about personality changes and side effects of the medication. His PCP instructed him to taper the medication, switching him to a 50 mg patch, but Mr. Kaufman removed the patch without a taper. 

He felt fine for a few days, but began to experience pain in his feet, LE edema, insomnia and rhinorrhea.  On the day of admission, he was watching television when he experienced the acute onset of shortness of breath and chest tightness. He described the chest tightness as    like someone sitting on    his R chest below his shoulder, with a band-like distribution across his upper chest, intermittent, non-radiating and somewhat relieved by moving his R shoulder.  This pain lasted 4-5 minutes but his shortness of breath persisted. The shortness of breath was worse with exertion, not improved with rest and caused his to take rapid shallow breaths. He also began to have a non-productive cough this same day. This was the first time he has ever experienced this chest discomfort and shortness of breath. He denies nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, acid reflux sensation, PND, orthopnea, fever or sick contacts.

Radiology

	CXR 9/06/62: IMPRESSION: MILD INCREASE IN LINEAR OPACITIES LIKELY SECONDARY TO INTERSTITIAL EDEMA.



Cardiogram

EKG 9/06/62 04:41- 87 BPM, NSR, non-specific T wave abnormalities consisting of inverted T 

waves in aVL (unchanged from previous EKG 12/30/60), no evidence of ischemic changes



Assessment/Plan:

	In summary, Mr. Kaufman is a 53 year old man with a history of insulin-requiring DM, hypertension, chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C who presents with acute onset shortness of breath and chest tightness in the setting of opioid withdrawal. His initial cardiac markers were positive, but are hard to interpret as a sign of ischemia in the setting of renal failure. He has clinical evidence of pulmonary edema and findings on CXR suggestive of interstitial edema. However, his JVP was not elevated and he only presented with mild LE edema.  His symptoms of shortness of breath are consistent with left-sided heart failure, possibly caused by an ischemic event. His acute renal failure has multiple possible etiologies (some of which could occur concurrently) including CHF, drug toxicity (lisinopril and NSAIDs), DM-associated nephropathy, chronic hypertension and renal artery stenosis.



Problem List and Plan:

SOB/Chest tightness:

	--continue to cycle enzymes for R/O

-CXR AP and lateral to assess presence of pulmonary edema

	-TTE

	-diuresis with Lasix 20mg IV

	-Hydralazine 10mg QID & Isosorbide dinitrate 5mg PO TID 

	-d/c Lisinopril

-continue O2 at 2L, monitor O2 sat

	-monitor ins and outs, daily weights

	-obtain lipid panel to assess CAD risk factors and need for statin

Renal failure: acute over chronic, baseline nephropathy due to DM and HTN, history of 

+protein in urine, urine sediment spun, no signs of active sediment 

-urinary electrolytes to measure FENa

-d/c Lisinopril

-dose Neurontin according to renal function

-consider ruling out renal artery stenosis

-obtain urinary eosinophils to evaluate for interstitial nephritis

Hypertension: hypertensive emergency considered, but determined to be unlikely due to 

chronity of elevated SBP at similar values, under treatment

	-continue Toprol XL 100mg QD, Norvasc 5mg BID

-add Hydralazine 10mg QID, Isosorbide dinitrate 5mg PO TID

-monitor BP and signs and symptoms of target organ damage closely

Opioid withdrawal/pain management:

	-Morphine PRN

	-consult pain service

DM:

	-sliding scale insulin

	-obtain Insulin and C peptide levels because unclear if currently taking Insulin

Prophylaxis:

	-20mg Nexium PO QD

	-Heparin 5000 units SC BID

RE:		Ordonez, Yamilex
SNH#:	008-37-16

September 28, 2085

Reason for visit:  This is an initial visit on September 28th, 2085.  Yamilex is a 68-year-old woman who I know quite well status post a stroke in 2083.  

In 2083 Mrs. Ordonez presented with ataxia and dizziness.  She was found to have a left vertebral stenosis and a left posterior inferior cerebellar artery distribution stroke.  She was found to be hypertensive at that time and was started on atenolol.  

Mrs. Ordonez blood pressure was not well controlled on atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide.  Triamterene was added.  Unfortunately she represented with recurrent ataxia and dizziness possibly due to overtreatment of her blood pressure.  Of note, she was only mildly orthostatic at that time.  She also had an E. coli urinary tract infection which may have been complicating matters.   

Mrs. Ordonez has had borderline glucose intolerance as well as an elevated alkaline/phosphatase.  She had had a hemoglobin A1C of 6% tested in 2083.  

Yamilex is generally doing well.  She has no particular complaints.  She has had an active summer getting out to the beach and walks the shopping mall with her daughter with good energy.  She has had no chest pains, shortness of breath, alterations in her bowel or bladder habits.  

Medications:  Coumadin 2.5 alternating with 3.75 q.d. for her history of vertebral artery stenosis and atenolol 75 q.d.  

Physical examination:  Blood pressure was 170/90.  Heart rate was 82 and regular.  The HEENT examination was unremarkable.  Neck was supple without adenopathy.  There were 2+ carotids without bruits and there were no vertebral bruits.  Chest was clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam showed an S4 gallop.  Abdomen examination was benign and extremities were without edema.  Neurological examination showed reflexes to be 2+ in the upper extremities and at the knees bilaterally with downgoing toes.  Finger-nose-finger was intact, Romberg was intact, and gait was stable with a narrow base.  

Assessment and plan: 

1.	Hypertension.  Mrs. Ordonez blood pressure is currently not well controlled.  She has unfortunately had inadequate follow up for her hypertension.  I will start her on 5 mg. of Zestril in addition to her standing 75 of atenolol.  

2.	Neurologic.  Mrs. Ordonez is stable status post her stroke.  She will continue on Coumadin.  I will not plan any further neurological work up at this time.  

3.	Primary care issues.  Mrs. Ordonez had a cholesterol in 2083 of 210.  I will test a follow up cholesterol level given that she needs good secondary prevention status post her stroke.  I will also check a random glucose level today as diabetes does run in the family and Mrs. Ordonez has had borderline elevated sugars in the past.  

	I have also started Mrs. Ordonez on a multivitamin with minerals as well as 800 IU a day of vitamin E at the recommendation of Dr. Quesenberry.  I will see Mrs. Ordonez in approximately six to eight weeks to reassess her blood pressure and her response to the addition of lisinopril.

The patient was seen with Richard Quesenberry, M.D.

       Procedure: This 73 year old male with Cervical Herniation is scheduled for a Cervical Laminectomy with Fusion on Jan. 21, 2095 by Dr. Noah Blanchard



       Chief Complaint & History of Present Illness: This 73 year old gentleman has been  disabled assistance and wheelchair bound since 2066 when he suffered a compression fracture in a fall from a ladder at an amusement park.  He has been disabled but  has managed to stand  and get himself in and out of the wheelchair.  He began noticing cramps and tingling of both his upper extremities and they felt the same as before he had his cervical laminectomy in 2081. He was unable to grip his cup and began dropping objects. Nerve conduction studies were done in September 2094 the conclusion is that he has bilateral evidence of cervical polyradiculopathy right greater than the left.  evidence of sensory poly neuropathy there is also evidence to suggest a mild mean neuropathy at the wrists bilaterally





        Past Medical History:  

1.  Paraplegia secondary to Compression fracture in Amusement Park accident in 2066

2.  cervical spondylosis

3.  COPD uses prn Albuterol MDI

4.  CAD S/P CABG X3 in 2087 catheterization done in March 2090.  Recent stress done in May 2094

History of CABG, known hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, dyspnea on exertion, cancer, smoking. S/P B/L CEA, Cath '90 - occluded SVG to Cx, patent LIMA. patent SVG to RCA. Admitted with (L) sided chest pain, ruled out for MI by enzymes. Ruled out for aortic dissection by CT. Last Adeno-MIBI 3/2092 - posterior wall MI, Negative for ischemia. PURPOSE(S): Diagnosis of ischemia. DIAGNOSES: Primary diagnosis is chestpain. Additional diagnoses include hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia. MEDICATIONS: Albuterol, ECASA, Furosemide, Lopressor, Losartan. PROCEDURE: The patient underwent an adenosine stress test with exercise. Maximum adenosine dose: 140 ucg/kg/min. Supplemental arm exercise x 0:00 (min:sec). 1 lb hand held weight 1097MBq 99mTc sestamibi were injected intravenously following infusion of adenosine with exercise and tomographic imaging data acquired. Additional data were acquired following intravenous injection of another 406MBq 99mTc sestamibi at rest on the same day. Global LVEF was computed and qualitative assessment of regional systolic function was made. STRESS TEST RESULTS: DURATION @ MAX DOSE (min:sec) 5:00 HR (REST=>MAX) 56 => 74 (50% PREDICTED) BP (INITIAL=>PEAK) 150/60 => 150/60 (MINIMUM = 130/x) PEAK DOUBLE PRODUCT: 11100 ENDPOINT(S): The protocol was completed. Chest pain did not occur. REST ECG: The rest electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and T-wave abnormalities. Sinus bradycardia 56/min. First degree AVB STRESS ECG: No ST segment changes were observed during this test. Arrhythmias: None STRESS TEST COMMENTS Negative for ischemia. However, the sensitivity of Adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited. SCAN RESULTS: The left ventricle is normal in size. There is a moderate reduction in tracer activity in the posterobasal wall of the left ventricle which persists after reinjection at rest. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 50% on the stress study. Regional wall motion abnormalities were noted in the posterior wall on the stress study. CONCLUSIONS: The ECG response to pharmacological stress was negative for ischemia. The myocardial scans show posterobasal infarction without ischemia--LVEF=50%.

          Assessment:   ASA Physical Status:3 





               73 year old male with cervical disc herniation scheduled for Cervical  Laminectomy with fusion on Jan. 24, 2094 by Dr Blanchard.  He has co morbid diseases IDDM, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, COPD, Paraplegia, Hx of uti and depression. His last surgery was in 2092 ORIF left Tibia IV sedation with spinal anesthesia no complication noted in anesthesai record..  There has been difficulty placing the IV ( pt said this happens a lot). According to note from 3/07/81 anesthesia for previous cervical Laminectomy  Rapid sequence induction MAC #3 8.0 ETT easy intubation. Pt was a smoker for 50 years occasionally uses Albuterol with a spacer suggested he use it pre op .  He had a stress test done in May 2094 and it was negative for ischemia and a LVEF was 50%.  Report in this note under Medical Problems.  He was admitted for ""chest pain "" in May 2094 and he no longer is using the NTG sl or the Nitropace.  He was told the ""pains"" he feels is most likely from his CABG ( CABG X3)- Grafts to RCA patent,occluded at circumflex, LIMA patent and the post sternal pain. The stress test was done during this admission as well as a CAT scan to r/o aortic dissection. ( also negative)  his biggest problem seems to be his ""not very well controlled diabetes"".  There is a note from the May 2094 admission that he was to receive a trial of Nexium to see if his ""chest pain"" was epigastric"" but pt and wife said he never received this medication.  He denies any GERD or ""chest pain"" since may 2094.  He recognizes his hypoglycemia sx's and  also his hyper glycemia sx's ( blurred vision) when his blood sugar is 480.  He will not take his Glyburide the night before surgery and the morning of.. He will take 1/2 dose of Insulin the morning of 15 untis NPH.    He denies any medication allergies but staes that ""muscle relaxants"" cause his legs to become flaccid.

ACUTE STROKE CONSULTATION



Called urgently to N-23 for further evaluation of sudden speech difficulty in this 83 yo RH woman who had undergone cardiac cath three and a half hours earlier.  She has remained alert, without somatic motor or sensory complaints, no visual or aural complaints, but some word retrieval difficulty and perhaps slurring of speech.  When first evaluated, she remained alert, oriented to situation, moving all four extremities with fair strength; normal LT. NO dysmetria or ataxia. VF full; {PERRLA; EOMs full s ptosis or nystagmus; no obvious facial or lingual weakness; modulates voice well.  Names; repeats simple test  words, but errs  on 33rd artillery battallion (""33 battallion""); repeats, but elides single words. No R-L confusion, no finger agnosia; no achromatopsia.



NIHSS: 0000000000110= 2 (language/dysarthria)



Taken urgently to CT: no ICH, CTA witrhout obvuious cutoff; taken to MRI



PMH:

She is hospitalized currrently b/o dyspnea, nonSTEMIA, flash pulmonary edema, s/p cath, awaiting CABG b/o triple vessel disease.

Depression          

Hyperlipidemia          

Hypertension          

glucose intolerance          

Gastroesophageal reflux disease     ; EGD shows improvement in her ulcer.     

H/O humerus fracture          left humeral head; comminuted; spring, 2081

g5p5          

h/o transient global amnesia          3/'76; carotid dopplers with rt. 15% ICA stenosis

benign breast calcifications          9/'80 bx

Basal cell carcinoma          of nose; 7/2084

Osteoporosis          She declines Rx other than Ca/vit. D

Lower GI bleeding          

Colonic polyps    

Osteoarthritis

Never smoked.



ON ASA 81, on iv heparin until cath; iv nitroglycerin currently, metoprolol, captopril, nexium, atorvastatin, MVI and calcium supplements.  NKDA.  



IMPRESSION is of L opercular syndrome- embolic postprocedure.

However, MR-DWI suggests shower of several tiny foci, ditally in cortex anteriorly both on R and L, and old R talamocapsular lacune (possibly related to her 2076 event).



No a lysis candidate. Could resume heparin for her CAD, if indicated.

ID/CC: 49yoRHM w/ PMH signif for CAD, Afib, DM, Bipolar, who presents w/ RLE weakness/decreased sensation x 24hrs



HPI: 49yoRHM w/ PMH signif for CAD, Afib, DM, Bipolar, who was in USOH until 10d ago, when had weakness in his L arm.  Thought this was 2/2 sleeping on it.  Involved whole arm from shoulder down.  Was still doing his ADL's but felt like the arm was slightly weaker, took 4-5 days to get back to normal.  



Then, 12/12/11, was eating dinner w/ a friend, got up to go to BR, found he had RLE weakness/stiffness.  Noticed it was hard to climb stairs.  Went to sleep    woke up at 2am    nearly fell 2/2 weakness in his leg.  In addition, has sensory loss in RLE, esp foot - felt    cold and dead.     The sensory loss was worst distally, but extended up to his thigh.  Never had trouble speaking or understanding others, did not have a facial droop, no problems w/ his RUE.  Stayed in bed until am, when he called his PCP, who told him to come to ED.  



Of note, in Oct-Nov 2111, had cardiac cath x 2.  Had NSTEMI on Oct 8, 2111    taken to cardiac cath    cath showed significant RCA disease and 40% prox LCx    c/b Vfib needing defib    stent placed for stenotic RCA lesion, c/b dissection needing 2nd stent placed.  Post cath had Afib requiring amiodarone.  Then had subsequent cath Nov 1 after an episode of CP, stents patent, other vessels stable.  After his inpt cardiac hospitalization, was admitted to psych for 1 wk for suicidality/depression.  



Previously, in spring 2110, had L eye visual disturbance    nearly blind    went to GHIC where was dx'ed w/ retinal venous occlusion, treated w/ cortisone and laser surgery, w/ mild improvement in vision (now blurred in that eye).



No HA, no tinnitus, no vertigo.  No blurry vision except in L eye from venous occlusion, no diplopia.  No problems w/ speech.

CT-A head/neck: has aberrant origin of R vert from CCA, both ACA's come off of L carotid, also w/ bilateral fetal PCA's and likely congenitally small vertebrobasilar vessels.  No significant focal stenoses or atheromatous calcifications.  



EKG: pending



MRI L/S spine: negative



IMPRESSION:

49yoRHM w/ PMH signif for CAD, DM, Bipolar disorder, afib, s/p recent cardiac cath who presents w/ LUE weakness 10d prior to admission resolving after 4-5 days, and RLE weakness?/sensory deficit? Imaging reveals R precentral gyrus small infarct, L cerebellar infarct, no significant vessel stenoses.  Neuro exam w/ brisker reflexes on R, equivocal RLE weakness, R sensory sx, ? R upgoing toe.  Clinical picture and imaging are not consistent.  Unclear if pt is a poor historian and current sx are non-objective sensory findings and meaningful event was LUE weakness 4-5d ago.

NEURO: stroke w/u including TTE/Holter, lipids/lipoprotein/homocysteine.  

--Will also send hypercoag w/u (including hypercoag panel, PT20210, Factor V Leiden, APLA, lupus anticoagulant) given hx of retinal venous thrombus and young age.

--Will also send BCx2 given recent cardiac cath, although ESR wnl reassuring re ? of endocarditis.

--Will check A1c re ? of adequate DM control.

--Given psych hx, will check tox screen and LFT's.

--Unclear if afib was only in context of post-cath, post Vfib.  Will look for LAE, holter abnl.  Could make a case to anti-coagulate regardless as has had documented afib.  

CV: hold anti-htn meds now.  Continue lipitor at outpt dose.  Allow SBP up to 180.

PSYCH: continue w/ depakote and lithium.  Mood is ok now, but will need to be monitored.

FEN: no IVF, ada 1800 low chol/low fat diet.  

ENDO: NPH 20 bid for now, titrate up as needed, RISS.  Checking A1c.

PPX: put on sc fragmin, nexium.  Pneumoboots.

PICH CLINIC VISIT PT: Nora Greenwood Date of Visit: 3/17/81 ID/CC: 49F with type II DM, HTN, obesity, hidranitis suppurativa, panic attacks, and fibromyalgia presenting to PICH for f/u visit re: 1) DM, 2) hidrantis suppurative; 3) STD testing; 4) left shoulder pain and to sign up for narcotics log. 
HPI: Interval hx to be reviewed by specific issue. 1) DM: Most recent HgbA1c 2/02/81: 7.4% (previously 6.9) and urine microalb/crt: 62.8. 2/81 chem 7 wnl (na: 137, k: 4.1, BUN/CRT: 15/0.7), GLU: 186. AM FS: 109-160; 2 hour post prandial 114-115. ~ 2 episodes per month where she feels lightheaded, shaky and has to eat; has not checked FS at time of episodes; resolve with PO intake. Describes frequently missing meals; not eating breakfast. Continues to describe increased activity level. 
2) Hidranitis suppurativa: Referred to general surgeon Dr. Iyer at last visit. Nora saw Dr. Iyer on 3/02/81 who felt that given the broad extent of the left axillary involvement, she would require extensive debridement and excision, and likely flap rotation coverage. He, therefore, referred her to plastic surgery. Feels that she needs abx again bc of increasing drainage and erythema. Cipro has been most helpful recently. Previously cultured and negative for MRSA. Today, denies fever, chills, ns, lightheadedness, increasing pain. 
3) STD testing: Nora recently reported that her ex husband had told her that he had HCV while they were together but never told her. 11/80 HCV ab negative. Completed further STD testing at last visit and HbsAg, HBsAb, TA-IGG, and HIV were negative. Still have not been able to check GC and Chlamydia bc Nora feels she can not undergo pelvic exam given HS in groin area. Denies any vaginal discharge. Not currently sexually active. 
4) Shoulder/Arm pain: See note from 2/02/81 for full hx details. Had MRI scheduled for 2/9/81 but unable to go through 2/2 claustrophobia. Rescheduled for open MRI on 2/28/81 which she was able to complete. Have not yet received fax of results. 
5) Pain management/ Narcotics log: Because of pain 2/2 severe HS and now L shoulder, Nora has been taking percocet 5/325 q 4 hours. Reviewed policy for narcotics log.

A/P: 49F with type II DM, HTN, obesity, hidranitis suppurativa, panic attacks, and fibromyalgia; a/p to be discussed by specific issue. 1) DM: Most recent HgbA1c slightly above goal of <7 (7.4) and increased from prior HgbA1c 6.9. Suspect increased HgbA1c reflects recent cessation of metformin which Nora was not able to tolerate. Per her report, fasting AM FS appears most elevated, although random BG checked at last was 186. Asked Nora to keep a log of her FS, checking fasting, 2 hour post-prandials, and qhs FS on alternating days. 
----increasing Glucotrol XL 2.5 mg qd to 5mg qd and suggested taking at night given elevated fasting FS, skipped breakfast but larger dinner, and daytime episodes of presumed hypoglycemia. 
----once again reviewed the importance of regular, small meals given glucotrol; discussed considering switch to short-acting glucotrol Nora   s slightly irregular food intake to avoid hypoglycemic episodes. Will consider switch at next visit and with review of FS log. 
----Asked nora to check FS during episodes of shakiness; will need to monitor closely given recent start of BB and concern that it may mask sx   s. Discussed this w Nora and once again emphasized importance of regular meals on glucotrol.
----continue ASA 81mg qd, lisinopril 40mg qd
----2/81 urine microalb/crt: 62.8, above goal of <30 and likely due to persistently elevated BP. Adding additional blood pressure agent today (toprol XL) and will re-check malb/crt once BP under better control. 2/81 BUN/CRT: 15/0.7. 
----will perform DM foot exam at next visit. Nora denies any numbness or tingling of extremities at this time.
----BP still not at DM goal of <130/80; adding Toprol Xl 25mg qd to HCTZ 25 qd and Lisinopril 40 qd
----11/80 (NON-FASTING): TCHOL: 189; HDL: 48, TRIG: 154, LDL: 110; on Simvastatin 80mg qhs. LDL slightly above DM goal of <100, but Nora has since attempted to increase exercise and eat low fat, low cholesterol diet. Rechecking lipid panel today. 
----OPTHO: will need to confirm appt at f/u visit 2) Hidranitis suppurativa: 
----will confirm referral to plastics and schedule if necessary
----prescribing course of cipro given e/o inflammation (less than previous flares) on exam today. 3) STD testing: Recent rpr, HIV, HBC, and HCV neg. Still not able to test for GC/Chlamydia, but no sx   s at this time to suggest infection. Will continue to offer, but again Nora declined given significant groin HS. 
----recommended HBV vaccination and gave Nora green slip4) Left Shoulder/Arm pain: Suspect multifactorial 2/2 possible rotator cuff injury, biceps tendonitis, and adhesive capsilitis. Offered steroid inject at last visit, but Nora declined and continues to decline. 
----will call about MRI results and consider treatment pnd results5) Pain control/Narcotics log: Given increased use of short-acting percocet, started long-acting MS contin 15mg BID and encouraged use of percocet for break-through pain. No trouble w constipation at this time, but warned Nora of increased risk given daily use of narcotics and encouraged hydration and increased fiber intake. Also reviewed Narcotic log contract and conditions. Nora is aware of conditions and rules as well as risks/benefits of chronic narcotic treatment. She agreed to drug testing today as well as all conditions described in contract.
----checking urine drug test today (Nora affirmed use of valium and percocet at 6:00am) 6) HTN: Still above goal of <130/80 and with e/o microablumin on 2/81 urine test on HCTZ 25mg qd and lisinopril 40mg qd. Will add toprol XL 25mg qd today. Discussed possible side-effects including fatigue, mood changes, etc. 
----scheduled f/u with NP in 10d to re-check BP and HR; consider increasing dose if still not at goal and HR tolerates. Will also assess for development of any SE at that visit. 
----TO DO: review sleep apnea ROS at next visit and will need to re-visit smoking cessation
7) Elevated AP: Suspect 2/2 fatty liver (elevated GGT confirming GI source and RUQ w e/o fatty liver) and asx at this time; continue RF modification (wt loss, strict lipid control). Will re-check in 6 mos (~7-8/81). Consider GI eval if significant elevation or symptoms. 
8) Panic attacks: continue tx through psych (CBT and valium prn). 
----confirm f/u appt w psych at next visit
9) +FH of ovarian cancer (mother, sister, maternal GM died of ovarian CA). Has had multiple previously scheduled appts to see high risk clinic at MTCI. Again offered to re-schedule for her, but Nora said that she had the number and was going to reschedule. Asked her to call me with date to confirm. 
10) TOBACCO USE: Nora reported quitting at last visit but today smelled of smoke. Confirmed that she had restarted, ~ 4 cig/day. Will need to discuss further at next visit and once again review crucial nature of smoking cessation for her. 
11) HCM
----11/3/80 LIPID PANEL: (NON-FASTING): TCHOL: 189; HDL: 48, TRIG: 154, LDL: 110; rechecking today. 
----PAP SMEAR: Pt overdue for pap; once again asked to defer given severe pain 2/2 HS; will continue to offer; discussed my concern regarding continual deferral of pap and the risks that this posses. Nora states that she understands risks but feels that exam would be impossible given pain. 
----MAMMOGRAM: Scheduled on several occasions, but never obtained bc of pain. Nora still feels that examine would be impossible given HS. Will continue to discuss and work to get treatment for her HS. Expressed my concern regarding continual deferral of mammogram and risk for cancer. Nora states that she understands risk but simply feels that it would be impossible given level of pain. I offered to give her pain medications but she still does not feel that she could undergo this test yet. Will continue to discuss with her. 
----DV SCREEN: negative today; ex-husband again in prison. Previous h/o abuse. Will continue to screen. 
----Ca and VIt D: gave her PICH pt education handout regarding daily requirements 
----SEATBELTS: + use
----OP: review OP RF at next visit
TO DO:
----will need to review previous OPTHO findings; Nora mentioned that her opthomologist mentioned something I    should know   ; asked her to get phone number so I can call him to find out what she is referring to. 
Pt to RTC in 1 mos or sooner if needed. Will call Nora with results of MRI. Pt was presented to and plan discussed with attg, Dr. Xian.

This patient of Dr. Bridges was seen because Dr. Bridges was
called away on an emergency basis.

His major concern is results of recent vascular studies.  He has
known diabetes and has a history of several years of exertional
cramping and discomfort in his legs.  This occurs only with heavy
exertion.  Dr. Bridges documented normal pedal pulses the last
visit.

His recent vascular studies showed no significant drop off and
perfusion pressures level of the ankle.

Did given his history a more inclined to suspect this might be
pseudoclaudication due to neuropathy or spinal stenosis.  He will
follow up with Dr. Bridges about next steps.

Ret he declines a flu shot today.

Microbiology:

NA



Radiology:

CXRAY:

Interstitial pulmonary edema, improved from the previous

examination.



EKG: Resolution of the previously Nov-2078 present ST Elevations in V1-V2; LVH

	

Assessment/Plan:

 51 yo F with hx of diastolc dysfunction and recent admission with flash pul edema in the setting of elevated BP, p/w similar symptoms, i.e. acute CHF in setting of severe HTN, no troponin leak, no new ischemic EKG changes



1.CARDS

-Serial EKG's

-Cardiac monitor, telemetry

- Serial Markers

-ASA, Lopressor

-BP ctrl with ACE-I & B-blocker, aiming for SBP goal of 140's-160's for overnight  (BP had been as high as 220's)

-Lipitor; Check fasting lipids   

-Lasix as needed; Strict I/O's, qd wt's

-No need for ECHO or Adenosine-MIBI on this admission given no new EKG changes 

 

2. HTN:

- seems to be well controlled at this time

- if becomes difficult to control will titrate BB up and consider affing another agent 

- may need to be worked up for 2/2 cause of HTN, such as RAS



3. Hx of med noncompliance:  

- will need repetitive reinforcement re importance of adherence to medical regimen

- will discuss potential benefit from being plugged into the CHF clinic

- consider nutrition consult

 

4. Anemia

-Guaiac all stools; 

- Resend iron studies, peripheral smear, retic count, folic acid, B12

- Consider transfusing idf HCT < 30



5. FEN: Low Sodium, Low Cholesterol, Low Fat Diet; Replete lytes as needed



6. Prophylaxis: 

Nexium

	OXFORD DELTA CLINIC
	


	Reason for visit:
   s/p Coronary angiogram with placement Cypher stent to LAD


	Interval History:
   The patient is a 70 yo male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, CAD and CABG September 2092 which was c/b premature graft failure of the SVG to LAD. Cardiac catheterization was performed in Jan 93 and underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD, but never really improved. He was admitted to ODC in May 94 and cath demonstrated severe native disease with a mid-LAD lesion which was treated with PTCA/ Taxus stent. He had symptomatic relief until about one month ago when he began to experience exertional discomfort and dyspnea which has now progressed to symptoms at rest despite an aggressive medical regimen. He presented today for cath which revealed a new stenosis distal to the prior LAD stent which was patent. The lesion was stented with a 2.25 x 13 mm Cypher stent. he is now admitted to the Cardiology department for post procedure monitoring and arrived to cardio clinic pain free and hemodynamically stable.


	Past medical history:
   DM 
HTN 
Hyperlipidemia 
CAD -CABG x 3 September 2092 WMMC (LIMA to D2, SVG to RCA, SVG to LAD) s/p PCI prox LAD Jan 2093, s/p Taxus stent to LAD 5/94 
GERD s/p H pylori eradication several years ago 
Left rotator cuff injury s/p CABG
